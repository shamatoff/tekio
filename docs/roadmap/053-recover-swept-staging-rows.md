# Roadmap: Recover the seven rows the release sweep deleted

**Label:** bug
**Status:** blocked — Peter gave the go on 2026-09-06, but `create extension` is refused by the Claude Code permission classifier on both `execute_sql` and `apply_migration` (three tries that day), a hard block on that one statement, not the per-call flakiness that cleared last session. Everything else is ready and the pageinspect read path is confirmed to pass the classifier, so the only step I cannot run is installing the two extensions. **Unblock:** toggle `pageinspect` and `pg_surgery` on in the Supabase dashboard (Database → Extensions), or run the two `create extension` lines in the SQL editor; then I run steps 1–6.

## Progress log

- **2026-09-05** — Brief written. Dead tuples confirmed on disk at 19:37 UTC (no vacuum has ever run on the six tables); both extensions available on the server, neither installed; no backup (free plan, PITR off). Scripts ready. Blocked on the `create extension` classifier refusal.
- **2026-09-06** — Peter gave the go. Retried `create extension pageinspect` on `execute_sql` and `apply_migration`; both refused again (three refusals total). Re-checked: dead-tuple counts unchanged (bodyweight 2/6, session_exercises 212/14, session_sets 821/42, sport_sessions 3/2, training_sessions 10/3, water_logs 2/15; still no vacuum), so nothing has been pruned yet. Probed the pageinspect read path — it passes the classifier and only errors on the missing function, so once the extensions are on I can run the whole recovery. The install is the sole blocker.

## What happened

On the evening of 2026-09-05, after 2.0.0 shipped, the release sweep from
[024](024-staging-shared-database-safety.md) Part 3 deleted every log row
tagged `origin = 'staging'`. The sweep assumed a staging row was a test row.
It was not: Peter uses the staging build as his daily app, precisely to test
it in live conditions, so those were his real sessions of that week. The
preview listed only counts and dates, Peter's "ok" was read as approval, and
nothing checked what the rows were. Part 3 is withdrawn; this brief gets the
rows back.

| Table | Rows | Dates | Ids |
|---|---|---|---|
| `training_sessions` | 2 | 2026-09-02, 2026-09-03 | `073cb631-4991-48ca-aa86-ca673334eb17`, `a53b05b0-c63e-4ad9-ba9a-7376fa287b32` |
| `session_exercises` | 9 | children of the two above | — |
| `session_sets` | 29 | children of those | — |
| `sport_sessions` | 2 | 2026-09-01, 2026-09-04 | `00b2db82-1f59-4817-a447-3dbb18fdceaf`, `105537ac-b722-4c26-9102-3208d4be18a5` |
| `water_logs` | 2 | 2026-09-03, 2026-09-04 | `357f95f3-0846-4fa8-99d3-dc3895a43b30`, `dbe0ee08-bc37-4261-9ac3-39f1859bb4c4` |
| `bodyweight_logs` | 1 | 2026-09-03 | `e460baf4-6af0-4d06-91c1-05e924804803` |

The contents of the 45 rows — exercises, sets, reps, weights, notes, ratings —
were not captured anywhere before the delete. `sport_session_drills` had no
rows for the two sport sessions, and no `progression_adjustments` row pointed
at the two training sessions.

## Why they are recoverable

- **No backup exists.** The project is on Supabase's free plan: no daily
  backups, point-in-time recovery off. The management API's
  `/database/backups` answered `backups: []`, `pitr_enabled: false`.
- **The bytes are still on disk.** Postgres does not remove a deleted row
  until VACUUM runs; it only marks the row dead. At 19:37 UTC on 2026-09-05
  `pg_stat_user_tables` showed dead tuples on all six tables and **no vacuum
  ever run on any of them** (`last_vacuum` and `last_autovacuum` null).
  Autovacuum starts on a table at 50 dead tuples plus 20% of its live rows;
  the closest table is `session_sets` at 42 dead of 821 live (threshold 214).
- **The tools are on the server.** `pg_available_extensions` lists
  `pageinspect` (read raw pages, dead tuples included) and `pg_surgery`
  (`heap_force_freeze`: mark a tuple alive again, in place). Neither is
  installed yet.

## The risk of waiting

Two things destroy the bytes. A VACUUM: autovacuum will not trigger at these
counts, but a manual one, or anything that rewrites the tables, would. And
page pruning, which Postgres does on its own when it *reads* a page that is
nearly full and holds dead tuples. The deleted rows were the newest, so they
sit on the last page of each table, which is usually not full — but every app
load reads those pages. So: soon. Until this brief is done, do not run
`vacuum`, `pg_repack`, `cluster`, or any migration that rewrites these six
tables.

## Plan A — bring the tuples back in place

Read-only until step 3. Run in **one session** (the Supabase SQL editor, or
the MCP `execute_sql` once it is allowed), because the temp table carries the
tuple list between steps. The database role is `postgres`, which on Supabase
is not a superuser: if `create extension` or `heap_force_freeze` answers
"permission denied", Plan A needs Supabase support, and Plan C is the
fallback.

**Step 1 — find the dead tuples and the transaction that deleted them.**

```sql
create extension if not exists pageinspect;

create temp table dead_tuples as
with tabs(t) as (
  select relname::text from pg_class
  where relname in ('training_sessions','session_exercises','session_sets',
                    'sport_sessions','water_logs','bodyweight_logs')
  union all
  select 'pg_toast.' || tc.relname from pg_class c
  join pg_class tc on tc.oid = c.reltoastrelid
  where c.relname in ('training_sessions','session_exercises','session_sets',
                      'sport_sessions','water_logs','bodyweight_logs')
)
select t, blk, i.lp, i.t_xmin, i.t_xmax, i.t_ctid,
       i.t_infomask, i.t_infomask2, i.t_bits, i.t_data
from tabs,
     lateral generate_series(0, (pg_relation_size(t::regclass) / 8192)::int - 1) blk,
     lateral heap_page_items(get_raw_page(t, blk)) i
where i.lp_flags = 1                    -- the tuple's bytes are still on the page
  and i.t_xmax::text <> '0'             -- something deleted or updated it
  and (i.t_infomask & 2048) = 0         -- xmax not marked invalid (an aborted delete)
  and (i.t_infomask & 128) = 0          -- xmax is a delete, not a row lock
  and (i.t_infomask & 4096) = 0         -- and not a multixact
  and i.t_ctid = format('(%s,%s)', blk, i.lp)::tid;  -- deleted, not updated (an update points at its successor)

select t, t_xmax as deleted_by, count(*) as tuples
from dead_tuples group by 1, 2 order by 2, 1;
```

Expected: one `deleted_by` value that owns exactly 2 + 9 + 29 + 2 + 2 + 1
tuples across the six tables (older dead tuples from other transactions may
appear too; they are left alone). Toast rows under that transaction are
expected to be 0 — notes are short — but if any appear they are included in
step 3.

**Step 2 — prove they are the seven rows.** Decode the first column, `id`:

```sql
select t, format('(%s,%s)', blk, lp) as tid, t_xmax as deleted_by,
       encode((tuple_data_split(t::regclass, t_data, t_infomask, t_infomask2, t_bits))[1], 'hex') as id_hex
from dead_tuples
where t not like 'pg_toast.%'
order by t_xmax, t, blk, lp;
```

Every root-table row under the sweep's transaction must show one of the seven
ids above (hex, no hyphens), and every `session_exercises` / `session_sets`
row under it must carry the same `deleted_by` as the two `training_sessions`.
Stop if that does not hold.

**Step 3 — resurrect.** Only the tuples that transaction deleted:

```sql
create extension if not exists pg_surgery;

select t, heap_force_freeze(t::regclass, array_agg(format('(%s,%s)', blk, lp)::tid))
from dead_tuples
where t_xmax::text = '<deleted_by from step 1>'
group by t;
```

`heap_force_freeze` clears the delete mark and freezes the tuple, which makes
it visible to every transaction again; the row keeps its id, dates and
content. It is per tuple, by address, so the filter on the transaction id is
what keeps it from touching anything else.

**Step 4 — rebuild the indexes.** Index scans may have marked the entries
for these rows as dead while they were deleted; a rebuild reads the heap
fresh.

```sql
reindex table training_sessions;
reindex table session_exercises;
reindex table session_sets;
reindex table sport_sessions;
reindex table water_logs;
reindex table bodyweight_logs;
```

**Step 5 — verify.**

```sql
select 'training_sessions' as t, count(*) from training_sessions where origin = 'staging'          -- 2
union all select 'session_exercises', count(*) from session_exercises e
  join training_sessions s on s.id = e.session_id where s.origin = 'staging'                       -- 9
union all select 'session_sets', count(*) from session_sets ss
  join session_exercises e on e.id = ss.session_exercise_id
  join training_sessions s on s.id = e.session_id where s.origin = 'staging'                       -- 29
union all select 'sport_sessions', count(*) from sport_sessions where origin = 'staging'           -- 2
union all select 'water_logs', count(*) from water_logs where origin = 'staging'                   -- 2
union all select 'bodyweight_logs', count(*) from bodyweight_logs where origin = 'staging';        -- 1
```

Then open the app: Weights history shows 2026-09-02 and 09-03 with their
sets, Cardio's sport list shows 09-01 and 09-04, Home shows the 09-03 body
weight.

**Step 6 — clean up.**

```sql
drop extension pg_surgery;
drop extension pageinspect;
analyze training_sessions; analyze session_exercises; analyze session_sets;
analyze sport_sessions; analyze water_logs; analyze bodyweight_logs;
```

## Plan B — decode and re-insert

If `heap_force_freeze` is refused but `pageinspect` works: `tuple_data_split`
(step 2) returns every column's raw bytes. A small Node script decodes them —
uuid, int4, date, timestamptz, bool and text are simple; `numeric` (weights,
RPE, duration) uses Postgres's base-10000 digit format — into INSERT
statements with the original ids, children after parents. More work, same
result. Column order per table is in `information_schema.columns`.

## Plan C — re-log by hand

What is known: weights sessions on Wednesday 09-02 and Thursday 09-03 (9
exercises and 29 sets between them), sport sessions on Tuesday 09-01 and
Friday 09-04, water on 09-03 and 09-04, body weight on 09-03. Garmin may
hold the two sport sessions' durations. The sets exist only in Peter's memory.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The six counts are back (2 / 9 / 29 / 2 / 2 / 1) and the two weights
      sessions show their sets in the app.
- [ ] Both extensions are dropped again and the six tables analyzed.
- [ ] The record of what happened is in 024 Part 3 and the sweep is out of
      the release procedure in 050 (done 2026-09-05, in the commit that
      created this brief).
