# Roadmap: Adaptations read — ground what the page shows

**Label:** feature
**Status:** in progress — unit 1 shipped 2026-09-02 (v1.13.0). Scout runs: S2
landed (v1.13.1), S1 + S3 landed (v1.13.2), S1's level-3 zeroing shipped via
[done/042](done/042-level-3-link-audit.md) (v1.14.0, 2026-09-03); S12 + S4 blocks
landed 2026-09-03 (v1.14.1); units S12 (v1.16.0) and S4 (v1.16.1) shipped
2026-09-03; S5 + S6 blocks and units shipped 2026-09-03 (v1.16.3, run
inline in the main session — §6.9) — **next: S7 + S8** (their subagent runs died
on API 529 overloads — §6.8; run them inline the same way), then S9–S11 (§6.5
step 2). The exercises the scouts name are
now in the catalogue with links ([043](done/043-scout-named-exercises-catalogue.md),
2026-09-03). Gates
[031](031-adaptations-drill-down-read.md); retires
[001](001-cross-adaptation-rep-ranges.md).
**Depends:** 019
**Release:** 2.0.0
**Covers inventory rows:** 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5 in
[grounding-inventory.md](../grounding-inventory.md), plus one number that has no
row at all (`CYCLE_SET_TARGET`, replaced by `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` under §6.6).

## The plain summary

The Adaptations tab is a **read**, not a capture screen — the drill-down behind
Home's five-second answer. A read is only worth building if its numbers mean
something. Right now the page shows three different answers to the same
question and about thirty-five prescription numbers that nobody has checked.

**This brief settles the meanings. [031](031-adaptations-drill-down-read.md)
then draws them.** In that order, for the same reason 031 already waited for
019: repainting a number that is about to change its denominator is throwaway
work.

---

## 1. The page answers "how much has this muscle had" three different ways

All three ship today. Two of them are on this tab.

| Where | Function | Window | Denominator | Split by adaptation? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home's body map | `muscleStates` ([fusedRead.ts:57](../../src/lib/fusedRead.ts#L57)) | rolling **42 days** (`CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS`) | `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` = **60** weighted sets | no — one total |
| Adaptations tab, per-adaptation body map | `adaptationCoverage` ([lib/adaptations.ts](../../src/lib/adaptations.ts)) | **week-to-date** | that adaptation's `weeklyMuscleTarget` (6 / 6 / 10 / 6) | yes |
| Adaptations tab, MUSCLE COVERAGE card | `muscleCoverage` ([utils.ts](../../src/lib/utils.ts)) | **week-to-date** | none — bars are relative to the busiest muscle | no |

Three windows, three denominators, one silhouette. A muscle can read dark on
Home and pale one tap later, and both are "correct". That is the confusion the
page has, and no amount of restyling removes it.

**A finding worth keeping:** `CYCLE_SET_TARGET = 60` is documented in its own
comment as *"10 fractional sets/muscle/week × 6-wk cycle"* — that is the
**hypertrophy** volume band (Schoenfeld 2017, Pelland 2026, Baz-Valle 2022,
grounded in [010 §Grounding](done/010-home-fused-reads.md#grounding)). So Home's
map is not a neutral total-stimulus read: it is denominated in hypertrophy and
labelled as though it were adaptation-agnostic. That may still be the right
default — hypertrophy is the volume-hungriest of the four — but it is a claim,
it is currently unstated, and it decides whether the per-adaptation maps in 031
are the *same* picture at higher resolution or a *different* picture wearing the
same ink ramp.

### The decision this brief owes 031

Pick one and write down why:

- **(a) One canonical accounting.** One function, one window, one weighted-set
  unit; the per-adaptation view is that same number filtered by adaptation, and
  Home's total is the sum. Cheapest to explain, and the drill-down genuinely
  drills *down* rather than sideways.
- **(b) Two honest reads, explicitly labelled.** Home stays cycle-shaped
  ("have I covered this muscle over the cycle"), the tab stays week-shaped
  ("am I hitting this adaptation's weekly dose"), and each says its window on
  screen. Defensible — they are different questions — but it needs the labels
  to carry the whole distinction.

**Recommendation: (a), with the window as the one thing that stays plural.**
Same function, same weighted-set unit, same target semantics; the caller picks
the window, and the window is named on screen. That kills the third dialect
outright and leaves the two survivors provably consistent.

## 2. Nothing on this page has a live grounding carrier

The numbers the page renders are indexed, but their assigned briefs are gone or
parked:

| Inventory rows | What they are | Assigned to | Problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1, 7.4, 7.5 | `LEVEL_WEIGHT` (a level-2 muscle gets half a set), the 5 mobility-min target, and the on-track/needs-work/untouched cut | `home-fused-reads` **(due)** | 010 shipped and is in `done/`. These rows point at a brief that will never run again |
| 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.10 | Power / strength / muscular-endurance `rx` prose and `ADAPTATION_PRINCIPLE` | `cross-adaptation-rep-ranges` | [001](001-cross-adaptation-rep-ranges.md) is `backlog` and is about a *different* question — whether classification should be fuzzy |
| 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 | Anaerobic / VO₂max / endurance `rx` prose | `hr-zone-intensity-classification` | [005](005-hr-zone-intensity-classification.md) is about *classifier thresholds*, not the prescriptions the page prints |
| — | `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` = 60 | — | **Has no inventory row at all**, despite being the denominator of the whole Home map |

Row 7.1 is the sharpest: *"Every muscle-coverage number and the whole BodyMap is
denominated in this."* The redesign makes the body map the centre of the page.
Making an ungrounded denominator more prominent is the wrong direction.

Row 3.4 and row 3.8 are the loudest: the app ships **"Galpin's 3–5 rule"** and
**"the classic 4×4 min at 90–95% HRmax"** as settled fact, unattributed. 031
keeps that text — behind an icon, but still on the page.

---

## 3. Scope

**In — decide and record:**

1. **The accounting decision in §1**, written into this brief with its reason,
   and implemented: one weighted-set function, or two with on-screen labels.
   Delete whichever of the three dialects loses. **Added 2026-09-02 (§6.0):**
   the rep bands that classify a set (`repRange`, inventory rows 2.1–2.3, and
   the keyword rules in 2.6) are in scope too — they are grounded here and
   made to overlap, so one set can feed several qualities.
2. **`/ground` runs** for the rows this brief covers, landing as a `## Grounding`
   section here:
   - `LEVEL_WEIGHT` `{1: 1, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.25}` (row 7.1) — the fractional-set
     convention. This is the single highest-leverage number on the page.
   - The on-track / needs-work / untouched cut (row 7.5) and the ramp steps it
     feeds.
   - `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` = 60 as an *adaptation-agnostic* denominator — the value
     is grounded; what is ungrounded is using a hypertrophy band as the total.
   - The seven `rx` blocks (rows 3.3, 3.4, 3.6–3.9) and `ADAPTATION_PRINCIPLE`
     (3.10), with **attribution for the two named protocols** in 3.4 and 3.8 or
     their removal.
   - The 5 mobility-min-per-muscle target (row 7.4) if the redesign keeps a
     recovery axis on this page; drop the row from scope if it does not.
3. **Repoint the inventory** in the same change — rows 3.3–3.10 and 7.1/7.4/7.5
   name this brief as their carrier, verdicts updated, and a new row created for
   `CYCLE_SET_TARGET`. No TODOs left in the index (the rule
   [019](done/019-adaptation-model-simplification.md) followed).

**Out:**

- **Target *values*** — 1.2–1.9 are already grounded or `convention` in
  [011](done/011-adaptation-weekly-targets.md); their *shapes* belong to
  [012](012-adaptation-target-shapes.md). Do not re-run the scout on them.
- ~~Rep-range boundaries and fuzzy classification — 001~~ **Pulled in
  2026-09-02** (§6.0): 001's question is decided by this brief.
- **Cardio classifier thresholds** (rows 6.1–6.5, the ≥25/≥8 min heuristic, the
  TE cutoff) — [005](005-hr-zone-intensity-classification.md).
- **Any pixel of the redesign** — [031](031-adaptations-drill-down-read.md).

The split to hold in mind: **039 grounds what the page *displays* and how a
resistance set *classifies*; 005 grounds how cardio *classifies*.**

## 4. Doctrine §4 checklist

1. **Which read does this sharpen?** Adaptations and Home — both existing Core
   reads. No new surface, R1 untouched.
2. **What does it let me stop doing?** Stop maintaining three muscle-stimulus
   dialects; stop shipping two named protocols as anonymous fact; stop pointing
   ten inventory rows at briefs that cannot carry them.
3. **Input or destination?** Input. It changes what existing reads mean and adds
   no surface.
4. **Honest shape?** The question this brief exists to answer — §1 is exactly a
   "does this picture fit its data" argument (P2).
5. **Does it write a number claiming physiological meaning?** Yes, several. This
   brief *is* the grounding gate for them, so the `## Grounding` section is
   mandatory and must exist before 031 starts.

## Grounding

One `###` per scout run from §6.3, pasted verbatim on receipt after the PMID
check (`eutils esummary`, 2026-09-02; Crossref for the three papers outside
PubMed). Landed so far: **S1, S2, S3, S12, S4, S5, S6** (S12's and S4's code units are
§6.7; S5's and S6's §6.9). Still to run, two at a time (§6.5 step 2): S7 + S8,
then S9 + S10, S11.

### S1 — LEVEL_WEIGHT (fractional sets by muscle link level)

**Claim:** `LEVEL_WEIGHT = {1: 1, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.25}` — a logged set is credited to each muscle the exercise trains at 1.0 weighted set when the muscle is the primary mover, 0.5 when it is a secondary mover / synergist doing substantial work (triceps in a bench press, biceps in a row), 0.25 when it is a tertiary contributor or stabiliser (forearms in a deadlift, abs in an overhead press). The physiological claim: an indirect set delivers about half the growth/strength stimulus of a direct set, a tertiary set about a quarter. Every muscle-coverage number (Home map, per-adaptation maps, the "missing" ranking) is the sum of these weights against the 10-weighted-sets/muscle/week floor, so the tiers decide which muscles the app calls missing.
**Searched:** 2026-09-02 · **Verdict:** partially supported — level 2 = 0.5 is **supported**; level 3 = 0.25 is **convention only**, and the nearest measurements sit at zero
**Number to use:** level 1 = **1**; level 2 = **0.5** (pair-by-pair truth runs roughly 0.4–1.0; 0.5 is the pooled best fit and the only fraction ever tested against alternatives); level 3 = 0–0.25 — default **0**, i.e. collapse to two tiers. No study measures a quarter-set stimulus, the best-fit counting scheme in the literature has no tier below "meaningfully trained", and the minor contributors that were measured (hamstrings in squats, medial deltoid in bench press) did not grow — crediting them 0.25 hides gaps, the one error a "what's missing" read must not make.

#### Evidence
- `[literature]` The largest dose-response model classifies every set as *direct* ("the measured muscle(s) was likely to be the primary force generator in the exercise", e.g. pectoralis major in bench press) or *indirect* ("likely to be meaningfully trained but not the primary force generator (i.e., synergist)", e.g. triceps in bench press), then tests three counting schemes — total (indirect = 1), fractional (indirect = 0.5), direct (indirect = 0). "The relative evidence for the 'fractional' quantification method was strongest" for both hypertrophy and strength, and the authors conclude "distinguishing between direct and indirect sets appears essential". Two points for Tekiō: Pelland's "indirect" is exactly the level-2 definition (a synergist doing meaningful work), and the scheme has **no third tier** — a muscle below "meaningfully trained" is not an indirect set at all, so a stabiliser carries 0. Only 0, 0.5 and 1 were compared; 0.25 and 0.75 were never tested. Bayesian multi-level meta-regression, 67 studies, n = 2,058 (79 % male, mean age 25, mixed training status) — [Pelland et al. 2026, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41343037/) (PMID verified via eutils; full text paywalled — definitions quoted from the abstract and the authors' preprint)
- `[literature]` A review of the EMG evidence on counting limb muscles during multi-joint lifts concludes "the best advice would be to view set-volume on a 1:1 basis, then use logical rationale and personal expertise", while noting hamstring activation is "markedly lower" than quadriceps in squats and leg presses — i.e. the right fraction is pair-specific and can approach zero for some links. Narrative review, EMG studies — lowest literature tier — [Schoenfeld, Grgic, Haun, Itagaki & Helms 2019, Sports (Basel)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31336594/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Row vs curl, same arm-count and effort: elbow-flexor thickness +5.16 % from unilateral dumbbell rows vs +11.06 % from curls (p = 0.009) — the synergist set was worth **0.47** of the direct set. Within-subject (one arm each), 10 untrained men, 8 weeks, 2×/wk, 4–6 sets of 8–12 to failure — [Mannarino et al. 2021, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268995/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Same comparison by region: after 8 weeks, dumbbell curls grew the elbow flexors proximally 5 % and distally 11 %; dumbbell rows grew them proximally 5 % and distally 1 %. The indirect set matches the direct set at one site and does almost nothing at the other. Chronic experiment: 9 untrained men, 8 weeks, 2×/wk (an acute swelling experiment in 16 trained men is in the same paper) — [Leitão et al. 2025, Sport Sci Health 21:3197–3205](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01530-7) (no PMID; not indexed in PubMed)
- `[literature]` Pulldown vs curl runs the other way: a multi-joint programme (lat pulldown / bench press) and a single-joint programme (curls / extensions) grew elbow-flexor thickness +6.10 % vs +5.83 %, no difference — for this pair the indirect set was worth **≈ 1.0**. RCT, 29 untrained men (MJ 14 / SJ 15), 10 weeks — [Gentil, Soares & Bottaro 2015, Asian J Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26446291/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Adding curls and extensions on top of pulldowns and presses added nothing: +6.5 % (MJ only) vs +7.04 % (MJ + SJ) thickness, no between-group difference. RCT, 29 untrained men, 10 weeks — [Gentil et al. 2013, Appl Physiol Nutr Metab](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23537028/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The same null result in **trained** men: MJ vs MJ + SJ for 8 weeks — "no significant difference in any variable" for upper-body strength or size; the authors call MJ-only "time-efficient". RCT, 20 trained men (10 / 10), 8 weeks — [de França et al. 2015, Appl Physiol Nutr Metab](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26244600/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Pooled, single- vs multi-joint exercise produces a "trivial" difference in whole-muscle hypertrophy of the limb muscles, with individual studies showing single-joint work grows specific *subdivisions* better. Systematic review + meta-analysis, 7 studies / 10 nested comparisons — [Rosa et al. 2023, Strength Cond J 45(1)](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2023/02000/hypertrophic_effects_of_single__versus_multi_joint.5.aspx) (not in PubMed; journal abstract page)
- `[literature]` Bench press vs skull crusher for the triceps, by head: the bench-press groups grew the **lateral head** significantly more than the extension-only group; the extension groups grew the **long head** significantly more than the bench-only group; the medial head was "statistically similar between conditions". So the synergist fraction is ≈ 1 for one head and low for another; secondary readings of the figures put bench-only whole-triceps growth at roughly half the extension groups' (figure data, not in the abstract). RCT, 43 untrained young men in 4 groups (MJ, SJ, MJ + SJ, SJ + MJ), 10 weeks — [Brandão et al. 2020, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149887/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Bench press alone for 10 weeks grew the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, anterior deltoid and triceps brachii versus control, with the pectoralis major growing more than the triceps and pectoralis minor. The **medial deltoid** — the minor contributor in the lift — is the one measured muscle not reported as growing more than control. This is the only trial measuring a primary mover, its synergists and a minor contributor from the same sets. RCT, 24 men (13 trained bench only 3×/wk, 3–4 sets; 11 control), 10 weeks — [Lanza et al. 2024, J Bodyw Mov Ther 40:1417–1422](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39593465/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Over 24 weeks of bench press only (3 × 10 at 75 % 1RM, 3×/wk), triceps brachii and pectoralis major CSA both increased and followed the same time-course — the indirect stimulus is durable, not a beginner artefact. RCT (continuous vs periodic), 14 untrained young men — [Ogasawara et al. 2013, Eur J Appl Physiol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23053130/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Squats for 10 weeks: knee extensors +4.9 % (full) / +4.6 % (half), gluteus maximus +6.7 % / +2.2 %, adductors +6.2 % / +2.7 %, **hamstrings no significant change in either group** (rectus femoris also unchanged). A muscle that "assists" a squat the way a level-3 link is meant to received no measurable growth stimulus. RCT, 17 males (8 / 9), 10 weeks, 2×/wk — [Kubo et al. 2019, Eur J Appl Physiol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230110/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Squats for 9 weeks grew quadriceps (+3.6 ± 1.5 cm² vs hip thrust) and adductors (+2.5 ± 0.7 cm²) and glutes (similar to hip thrust), while "hamstrings growth was equivocal across both conditions" (0.1 ± 0.6 cm² between-group). Second independent zero for the same tertiary pair. RCT, 34 untrained college-aged adults (squat 16 / hip thrust 18), 9 weeks — [Plotkin et al. 2023, Front Physiol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37877099/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Fractional sets have become the field's working unit: a pre-registered multi-site equivalence trial prescribed "9 fractional sets per week" vs "36 fractional sets per week" in previously trained adults and found the two statistically equivalent for arm and thigh muscle area (0.023, 90 % CI −0.044 to 0.091). Bears on S3 (how much volume), cited here only because it shows the unit in use. **Preprint, not peer-reviewed**; 22 sites, 120 randomised / 87 completed, 12 weeks — [Steele, Gschneidner, Carlson & Fisher 2026, SportRxiv](https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/810)
- `[practitioner consensus]` Indirect stimulus is real and large enough to change programming. Israetel sets rear-delt MV and MEV at 0–4 sets/week "because the rear delts can get enough work to grow robustly … through proper back training", and warns that "if you reduce or remove upper body pressing movements from your program, the volume landmarks for the triceps will climb substantially"; Galpin: a chin-up "is primarily working back but indirectly working biceps". Held by Israetel and Galpin — [RP rear-delt guide](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/rear-delt-hypertrophy-training-tips), [RP triceps guide](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/triceps-hypertrophy-training-tips), [Galpin, Huberman Lab guest series pt 2](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/). No literature contradicts it (Brandão, Lanza, Ogasawara).
- `[single-practitioner position]` Do **not** count indirect sets; discount the *target* instead. "We only count sets where the target muscle is the prime mover or isolation exercises specifically targeting that muscle … when we say '18 sets is the MRV for triceps,' we mean direct triceps work only. We've already factored in the indirect volume from pressing movements, reducing our estimates." Israetel only (RP's written landmarks); Galpin disagrees (below). RP's own podcast pages, written by staff who are not roster members (Milo Wolf; "Dr. Pak"), teach the opposite bookkeeping explicitly — "Bench press: 1.0 sets for chest, 0.5 sets for front delts and triceps … Rows: 1.0 sets for lats, 0.5 sets for rear delts and biceps … Squats: 1.0 sets for quads, 0.5 sets for glutes" — so RP as an organisation holds both models at once — [RP volume landmarks](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth), [RP "11-set rule" page](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/podcasts/training-frequency-decoded-the-11-set-rule-every-lifter-should-know), [RP "truth about volume" page](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/podcasts/the-truth-about-volume-how-little-training-you-need-to-grow)
- `[single-practitioner position]` Count-or-don't is the lifter's call: "you can count it or not towards working set[s] — really depends on goals", against a baseline of "10 working sets per muscle group, per week (or up to 25 if highly trained)". Galpin only; Israetel says never count — [Galpin, Huberman Lab guest series pt 2](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No roster member, no RP page and no located study uses a **quarter-set** tier. Nobody holds 0.25; it exists only in `LEVEL_WEIGHT`.

#### Where they split
Three forks, and only the third is Tekiō's alone.

**1. Weight the set, weight the target, or let the lifter decide.** Pelland (and RP's podcast pages) put the discount on the *set* (0.5); Israetel's written landmarks put it on the *target* (direct-only counts against a pre-reduced MEV/MRV that differs per muscle); Galpin leaves it to the lifter per exercise. Everyone agrees the stimulus is real — this is a bookkeeping disagreement, not a physiological one. Tekiō has **one** floor (10/week) for every muscle, so the target-discount model is not available to it without a per-muscle target table; set-weighting is the only scheme that keeps a single denominator. That puts Tekiō on Pelland's side by construction, and 0.5 is his best-fit value.

**2. One constant or one fraction per link.** Inside the literature the level-2 fraction is pair-specific: ≈ 1.0 for pulldown → biceps (Gentil 2015) and for bench → lateral-head triceps (Brandão), ≈ 0.4–0.5 for row → biceps (Mannarino, Leitão), low for bench → long-head triceps. Schoenfeld 2019 says as much: default 1:1, then adjust per muscle. Pelland's 0.5 is the pooled compromise that beat 0 and 1 — it is a model fit, not a measured constant. The fork for Tekiō: keep one number per level, or move the fraction into the per-link `contribution` column of `exercise_muscle_groups`. Keep the constant at 0.5 now; the per-link column is the upgrade path. Do not replace 0.5 with an average of the pair results above — no study or practitioner holds such a number.

**3. Zero or a quarter for level 3.** Nobody outside this codebase holds 0.25. Pelland's scheme drops anything below "meaningfully trained" to 0; the three measured minor-contributor pairs (hamstrings in squats twice, medial deltoid in bench) show no growth over 9–10 weeks. The decision this forces: **collapse to two tiers** — but first audit the link table, because the change only removes stimulus that is not there if level 3 is reserved for stabilisers and minor contributors. Any real synergist currently tagged level 3 (RP's own examples: glutes in squats, rear delts in rows, front delts in bench) must be relabelled level 2 before the tier is zeroed, or the edit deletes real stimulus. If the caller keeps 0.25 anyway, it ships as a labelled convention, not as a finding.

#### Caveats
- Population mismatch: every synergist trial is 8–10 weeks in untrained men with n = 9–43, almost all on biceps and triceps. The one trained-men trial (de França, n = 20) found compounds cover the synergists at least as well in trained lifters as in novices, so the level-2 credit is not a beginner artefact. Pelland's pool is 79 % male, mean age 25, mixed status. One trained adult sits somewhere in the 0.4–1.0 spread per pair, not at 0.5.
- The fraction is hypertrophy-shaped. Strength gains in the same trials were exercise-specific (Mannarino: 10RM improved most on whatever exercise the arm trained), so crediting a row set as 0.5 of biceps *strength* is a looser claim than 0.5 of biceps *size*. S3 inherits this when it pools rep bands under one floor.
- A per-muscle read cannot see regions: bench alone grows the lateral head of the triceps ≈ fully and the long head little; rows grow the proximal biceps and not the distal. 0.5 is right on average and wrong at the head level, and the app should not pretend otherwise.
- 0.5 was never optimised. Pelland compared 0, 0.5 and 1 only; "fractional fits best" means 0.5 beat both extremes, not that it beats 0.4 or 0.6.
- The level-3 evidence is thin: two squat trials (hamstrings, n = 17 and 34) and one bench trial (medial deltoid, n = 24). Enough to say a quarter set is unmeasured and the nearest measurements are zero; not enough to say *every* stabiliser gets nothing. The bracing muscles the claim names (abs, erectors, forearms) simply have no growth data from compound lifts without direct work.
- What would move this number: a Pelland-style model comparison that includes 0.25 and 0.75 (would settle level 2's exact value); any trial showing a stabiliser grows from compound lifts alone (would resurrect a level-3 weight above 0); filling `exercise_muscle_groups.contribution` per link from the pair data above (would retire the level constant altogether).

```

**Decision (S1, 2026-09-02):** level 2 stays **0.5** (supported). Level 3 stays
**0.25 for now, labelled a convention.** The scout's default is 0, but its
precondition is not met: an audit of `exercise_muscle_groups` the same day
found 24 stimulus links at level 3, and roughly ten of them are real synergists
(adductors in squats, upper back in rows, face pulls and reverse flys) that
must move to level 2 before the tier can be zeroed, or the edit deletes real
stimulus. The relabel is Peter's call on his own anatomy tags —
[042](done/042-level-3-link-audit.md) carries the list and the proposed level per
link, and zeroing the tier lands there. The bookkeeping fork is settled by
construction: one floor for every muscle means the discount sits on the *set*
(Pelland), not on the *target* (Israetel's written landmarks).
**Landed 2026-09-03 (042, v1.14.0):** Peter ticked every row — 12 links to
level 2, the rest left at 3 — and `LEVEL_WEIGHT[3]` is now **0, grounded**;
inventory row 7.1 and ledger decision D13 record it.

### S2 — statusFor / GAP_CUTOFF (the on-track cut and the ramp)

**Claim:** Stimulus below the 10-weighted-sets/muscle/week floor is graded — every hard set buys some adaptation — so a continuous fill (sets ÷ floor) is the honest picture and the three-step cut in `statusFor` (0 → untouched, 0–10 → needs work, ≥10 → on track) is a coarsening of it. Sub-questions: (a) is any volume below the floor worth *zero* (a true threshold that would justify a step); (b) is `GAP_CUTOFF = 0.70` (7 sets/week) a physiological line or a display convention. Drives whether the Adaptations tab keeps three flat colours per muscle or draws Home's ramp, and where the "still a gap" callout stops.
**Searched:** 2026-09-02 · **Verdict:** supported — the ramp is honest and no sub-floor threshold exists; the 0.70 line is **convention only**
**Number to use:** fill = weighted sets ÷ 10 per week, continuous from 0; the only two steps with physiological content are **0** (no stimulus) and **1.0** (the grounded floor). `GAP_CUTOFF` 0.6–0.8 — default **0.70 (unchanged)**. No study draws a line at any fraction of the floor, but 0.70 sits just above the maintenance zone the literature does describe (roughly 0.1–0.6 of a full dose), so the callout stops nagging only once a muscle is clearly on the growth curve — a defensible convention, not a finding.

#### Evidence
- `[literature]` Hypertrophy rises with weekly sets in a graded, per-set way: each additional weekly set added ES +0.023 ≈ +0.37 % growth, modelled as a linear per-set slope with no threshold term. Systematic review + meta-analysis, 15 studies / 34 treatment groups, mixed training status — [Schoenfeld, Ogborn & Krieger 2017, J Sports Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The largest dose-response model finds a 100 % posterior probability that the marginal slope of volume is > 0 for both hypertrophy and strength, with *diminishing* returns (much steeper flattening for strength). A concave curve means the first sets buy the most per set — the opposite of a threshold. Fractional set counting (indirect sets = 0.5) fit best. Bayesian meta-regression, 67 studies, n = 2,058 (79 % male, mean age 25) — [Pelland et al. 2026, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41343037/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` One set per exercise already produces hypertrophy: ES 0.24 for 1 set vs 0.34 for 2–3 and 0.44 for 4–6 sets; multiple sets give ~40 % more, not "some vs none". Meta-analysis, 8 studies / 19 treatment groups / 55 effect sizes, trained and untrained — [Krieger 2010, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20300012/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` In resistance-trained men, 1 set per exercise × 3 sessions/week (≈3 sets/muscle/week, ~0.3 of Tekiō's floor) still increased muscle size at most sites and matched the 3- and 5-set groups for strength; higher volume grew more. RCT, 34 resistance-trained men, 8 weeks — [Schoenfeld et al. 2019, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153194/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` A single set performed 1–3×/week was sufficient for significant 1RM gains in resistance-trained men (overall +12.09 kg, 95 % CI 8.16–16.03). Systematic review + meta-analysis, 6 studies (5 pooled) — [Androulakis-Korakakis, Fisher & Steele 2020, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31797219/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Intermediate–advanced powerlifters gained strength on ~3–6 working sets of 1–5 reps per week above 80 % 1RM, spread over 1–3 sessions.

- `[literature]` Strength follows the same graded shape: low weekly sets ES 0.82 (95 % CI 0.47–1.17) vs high 1.01 (0.70–1.32) — the low category is large, not near zero. Meta-analysis, 9 studies / 61 treatment groups, novice to well-trained — [Ralston et al. 2017, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28755103/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` After 16 weeks at 3 sessions/week, cutting the dose to one-third or one-ninth for 32 weeks preserved the muscle gained in young adults (20–35 y) but not in older adults (60–75 y); strength was largely retained even with complete detraining. This is the *maintenance* line: ~1/9–1/3 of a full dose keeps muscle in the young. Two-phase randomised trial, n = 70 — [Bickel, Cross & Bamman 2011, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21131862/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Every resistance-training prescription beat control for both strength and hypertrophy; for hypertrophy "all prescriptions comparably promoted" growth. Any dose above zero counts. Bayesian network meta-analysis, 178 studies (n = 5,097) strength / 119 studies (n = 3,364) hypertrophy — [Currier et al. 2023, Br J Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37414459/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` A time-efficient practical minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group at 6–15 RM (≈0.4 of the floor) is proposed as still growth-producing. Narrative review — lowest literature tier — [Iversen et al. 2021, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34125411/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[practitioner consensus]` The adequacy floor sits near 10 working sets/muscle/week for a trained adult (Galpin: "target 10 working sets per muscle group, per week", up to 25 if highly trained; Israetel's MAV band 12–20 starts just above it). Held by Galpin and Israetel — [Galpin, Huberman Lab guest series pt 2](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/), [RP volume landmarks](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth). Already recorded in 010; repeated here only because it anchors the 1.0 step.
- `[single-practitioner position]` Israetel's landmark model is the only roster position that draws *steps* below the floor: MV ≈ 6 sets/week "preserve[s] your current muscle mass", below MV you lose, between MV and MEV you maintain but "only maintain" — i.e. growth is zero until MEV. Israetel only; Galpin names a single floor and no maintenance step; RP itself cut its MEV estimates in 2018 because "new research on even experienced lifters shows hypertrophy with much lower volumes than we had previously programmed" — [RP volume landmarks](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth), [RP Physique Templates 2.0](https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/male-and-female-physique-templates-20)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No roster member, and no located study, puts a line at 70 % of a target — or at any fraction of one. Nobody holds the number; it exists only in `GapMap.tsx`.

#### Where they split
The fork is Israetel's *threshold* model against the meta-analytic *curve*. Israetel's landmarks say volume below MEV grows nothing (a flat step, then growth); Schoenfeld 2017, Pelland 2026, Krieger 2010 and Currier 2023 fit curves that rise from the first set and flatten, and the trained-men trials (Schoenfeld 2019 at ~3 sets/week, Androulakis-Korakakis 2020 at one set) show growth and strength gains well inside Israetel's "maintenance only" band. Galpin sits with the literature: one floor, no step beneath it. This forces one choice on Tekiō: **is a muscle's state a category or a fraction?** The literature says fraction — draw Home's ramp on the tab, one ramp on both surfaces, and treat `statusFor`'s middle band as a *label* of the ramp (0 < fill < 1), never as a third flat colour with its own edge. The only step with physiological content below 1.0 is 0 vs > 0 ("untouched" is real: no set, no stimulus). Do not fix this by placing the middle edge at Israetel's MV or MEV — that would present one practitioner's model as the literature's shape.

#### Caveats
- Population mismatch: the dose-response models are group averages over 6–12 weeks in mostly young men (Pelland 79 % male, mean age 25); the trained-men data that matter most here are small (Schoenfeld 2019 n = 34; the powerlifter interventions n = 25). One trained adult sits somewhere on the curve, not at a point.
- Age moves the maintenance line: Bickel's 60–75 y group needed more than one-third of the dose to keep muscle. A user past ~40 should expect the low end of the ramp (0.1–0.35) to maintain less than it does in the trials.
- The ramp bands happen to bracket the maintenance literature — 0.10 ≈ Bickel's 1/9 dose, 0.35 ≈ his 1/3 dose, 0.70 just above Israetel's MV (≈ 0.6 of a 10-set floor). That is a coincidence worth noting, not a grounding: the steps were chosen for ink, and the literature merely does not contradict them.
- The fraction is only as honest as its numerator and denominator: it assumes fractional set counting (S1) and the 10-set floor pooled across rep bands (S3). If S3 moves the floor, every band on the ramp moves with it and 0.70 means a different set count.
- What would move this number: a trained-population trial showing *zero* growth at 3–6 direct sets/week (a real MEV) would justify a step at that fraction; a decision to change the read's meaning from "adequate" to "optimal" (010 §Where they split) would move the 1.0 step and, with it, where any gap line sits.

**Decision (S2, 2026-09-02):** `GAP_CUTOFF` stays 0.70 and `statusFor` keeps its three states, but both are now labelled as a *convention* over a continuous fill. 031 draws Home's ramp on the Adaptations tab (one ramp, both surfaces) instead of three flat per-muscle colours; the middle band is a label of the ramp, not a physiological edge.

### S3 — WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR / CYCLE_SET_TARGET as an adaptation-agnostic total

**Claim:** 10 level-weighted hard sets per muscle per week (60 per 6-week cycle), counted across every rep range — a 3-rep strength set, a 10-rep hypertrophy set, a 20-rep endurance set and a power set each worth one set — is a defensible floor for *total* muscle stimulus, because hypertrophy is the most volume-hungry of the four muscle-linked qualities and hard sets grow muscle about equally across the load spectrum. Drives Home's per-muscle fill (`muscleStimulus().total ÷ WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × weeks`) and the "what's missing" ranking. The *value* 10 is settled in 010 D10 and is not re-run here; this run rules on the *pooling*.
**Searched:** 2026-09-02 · **Verdict:** partially supported — pooling across 6–30+ reps is **supported**; pooling 1–5-rep heavy sets in full is **partially supported** (default: count in full); pooling power sets is **not supported** (default: exclude from the total); "meeting the floor covers strength, endurance and power too" is **partially supported** — it covers their *volume*, it is silent on strength's load, endurance's rep range and power's velocity.
**Number to use:** 10–20 pooled hard sets/muscle/week — default **10 (unchanged)**, cycle **60 (unchanged; honest band 50–60 per 010)**, where "hard set" = any resistance set at 1–30+ reps taken within a few reps of failure, and power-tagged sets (jumps, throws, swings — never near failure) count in `byQuality.power` only, at **0** toward the pooled total. A set near failure is the unit the volume literature is built on; a jump is not that unit, and no study gives it a fraction.

#### Evidence

*(a) Is a hard set worth the same across loads?*

- `[literature]` Hypertrophy is similar between low-load (≤60 % 1RM) and high-load (>60 % 1RM) training taken to failure; 1RM strength is significantly greater with high load.

*(b) Does a set that stops short of failure still count in full?*

- `[literature]` Heavy sets do not need failure: quadriceps CSA +7.7 % not-to-failure vs +8.1 % to failure at high load (1RM +33.4 vs +33.8 %).

*(c) Is the most volume-hungry quality's floor the right umbrella?*

- `[literature]` Volume raises both hypertrophy and strength (100 % posterior probability) with diminishing returns "considerably more pronounced" for strength; fractional set counting fit best.

- `[literature]` Local muscular endurance is rep-range-specific (Schoenfeld 2015: +16.6 % light vs −1.2 % heavy; Campos 2002: only the 20–28RM zone improved it). **No systematic review or meta-analysis of a weekly-set dose-response for local muscular endurance was located** (searched 2026-09-02); the pooled floor cannot claim to cover it.

*(d) The roster*

- `[single-practitioner position]` A working set counts toward the landmarks only inside "Load range: 30–85 % of 1RM, Rep range: 5–30 reps per set, Effort level: 0–4 reps in reserve", and within that band "a 5-rep set and a 30-rep set produce similar stimulus and fatigue". Sets below 5 reps / above 85 % 1RM, and any set at ≥5 RIR, are outside the model. Israetel only; Galpin's band starts at 4 reps and he is silent on pooling — [RP volume landmarks](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth)
- `[single-practitioner position]` Hypertrophy: "target 10 working sets per muscle group, per week (or up to 25 if highly trained)", "reps between 4–30 per set, stopping about 2 reps short of failure". Strength: the 3-to-5 concept — "3–5 exercises, 3–5 repetitions per set, 3–5 working sets, rest 3–5 minutes", 3–5 days/week; "you don't have to go to failure to see strength gains". A per-session prescription with no per-muscle weekly floor, and no statement on whether those heavy sets count toward the 10. Galpin only — [Huberman Lab guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/)
- `[practitioner consensus]` Power work is quality work, programmed apart from volume: Galpin puts it at 40–70 % 1RM, "quick, explosive", never to fatigue; Israetel's band requires 0–4 RIR, which a jump or swing set never meets. Neither counts a power set as a hypertrophy working set. Held by Galpin and Israetel — [Huberman Lab, Galpin episode](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-and-endurance), [RP volume landmarks](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth)

#### Where they split

Two forks, one real.

**1. Does a heavy triple fill the muscle's floor?** Israetel's landmark model says no — sets under 5 reps or over 85 % 1RM are not "volume" and sit in a separate strength bucket. Galpin's hypertrophy band (4–30 reps) admits a 4-rep set and says nothing about a triple, while his 3-to-5 rule programs strength per *session*, not per muscle per week. The literature sides with counting it: the one set-equated trained-men trial (Mangine 2015) found 4 × 3–5 grew as much or more than 4 × 10–12, and Campos 2002 found 3–5RM fibres grew like 9–11RM fibres; Schoenfeld 2014's 7 × 3 ≈ 3 × 10 is the only hint that a triple buys less per set, and its design cannot say so. Baz-Valle's set-as-unit review stops at 6 reps, so below that the per-set worth is honestly a band, ~0.4–1.0. **Tekiō must choose: pool 1–5-rep sets in full, or discount/exclude them as Israetel does.** Pool them in full — it is the doctrine's own rule (§6.0, "a set is a set"), the trained-men data lean that way, and any discount would be a number nobody holds. Do not resolve this by counting triples at 0.5: that is Pelland's *indirect-muscle* convention borrowed for a different question.

**2. Does a power set fill it?** No split — this is the rare case where both practitioners and the literature agree, and the app disagrees with all of them. A jump, throw or swing set is never near failure; Israetel's band excludes it by RIR, Galpin programs it as a separate quality, and the trials (Pareja-Blanco 2017; Lasevicius 2018 at 20 % 1RM; Lasevicius 2022 low-load not-to-failure at +2.8 %) show far-from-failure and very light sets grow a fraction of a hard set, with the fraction unmeasured for ballistic work. **Tekiō must choose: count power sets in the pooled total (simple, over-counts), or count them in `byQuality.power` only (honest, one branch in `muscleStimulus`).** Exclude them. The pooled floor is a *hard-set* floor — that is what its 10 was grounded on — and a muscle trained only with swings reading "fed" on Home would be a costume on one fact (P2). The power map still shows those sets, so nothing is hidden.

The claim's second half — "meeting 10 pooled sets covers the other three qualities" — splits by *dimension*, not by person. Strength needs less volume than hypertrophy (Pelland's steeper flattening; Androulakis-Korakakis; Ralston), so 10 pooled sets is enough *volume* for it; but strength is load-specific (Lopez SMD 0.60; Currier >80 % 1RM), endurance is rep-range-specific (Schoenfeld 2015, Campos), and power is velocity-specific (Jukic, Pareja-Blanco). The pooled total answers "has this muscle done enough hard work" and nothing else; the per-quality maps answer the specificity questions. That division of labour is exactly §6.0's design, and the total should be labelled as *hard sets*, not as coverage of four qualities.

#### Caveats

- Population mismatch: the load-equivalence trials are small and mostly untrained (Lasevicius 2018 n = 30, 2022 n = 25; Campos n = 32; Pareja-Blanco n = 22); the trained-men trials that decide the heavy end are n = 17–29 (Schoenfeld 2014, 2015; Mangine; Refalo 2024). The meta-analyses pool young adults (Pelland: 79 % male, mean age 25). One trained adult sits inside the bands, not on a point.
- **The app cannot see effort.** Tekiō logs reps and load, not RIR or velocity loss. The pooling therefore *assumes* every non-power set is a hard set. The literature says that assumption fails for light sets stopped early (Lasevicius 2022: +2.8 vs +7.8 %) and holds for heavy sets stopped 1–2 short (Refalo 2024). A 20-rep set logged at 8 RIR is over-counted and nothing here can catch it; an RIR field would.
- Light loads have a floor: below ~30 % 1RM a set to failure grows less (Lasevicius 2018 at 20 %). Any set the app classifies as muscular endurance at very light load is over-counted by an unknown amount; there is no way to see load-relative-to-1RM without a 1RM.
- The 1–5-rep verdict rests on two small trained-men trials that point different ways when read per set. A set-equated trial of 1–5 vs 8–12 reps with direct muscle measures in trained adults would settle it; until then full credit is the default, not a finding.
- Power exclusion is a classification change, not a new number: it moves sets between `total` and `byQuality.power` and depends on the keyword rule (row 2.6, S4) and the one override column being right. Today only one override exists (Dead Hang → muscular_endurance), so the practical effect on Home is small; that is a reason to do it cheaply, not a reason to skip it.
- The cycle arithmetic (10 × 6 = 60 with a half-volume deload → honest 50–60) is unchanged from 010 and not re-argued here.
- What would move this number: an RIR or velocity capture (would let the app discount sets far from failure instead of assuming); a set-equated heavy-vs-moderate trained trial (would fix the 1–5-rep worth); any dose-response for local muscular endurance (would say whether 10 pooled sets covers it); a decision to switch the read from "adequate" to "optimal" (010 §Where they split) would move the floor to 12–20 and the cycle target with it.

**Decision (S3, 2026-09-02):** the floor is a *hard-set* floor. `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR = 10`
now carries the pooling claim and `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` is derived from it
(`× CYCLE`), both unchanged in value. Sets at 1–5 reps count in full (the
literature leans that way and a discount would be a number nobody holds).
**Power sets leave `total`:** `muscleStimulus` counts a power set (override or
keyword) in `byQuality.power` only, so a muscle trained only with swings no
longer reads "fed" on Home. The §6.0 bracket therefore holds over the three
hard qualities, with power outside it. The muscle sheet says *hard sets* and
that power sets count on their own map; its two PLACEHOLDER marks on the
stimulus target are gone. Not addressed, by design: the app cannot see effort,
so every non-power set is assumed hard (an RIR field would fix that — not this
brief).

**Amended 2026-09-03 (§6.6):** the `× CYCLE` above is retired. The rate stays;
the window it multiplies becomes `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` (S12), and
`CYCLE_SET_TARGET` goes with it.


### S12 — MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS (the muscle read's own window)

**Claim:** `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS = 14` — a muscle's level-weighted hard sets are summed over a rolling 14-day window and compared with 20 (= `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR` 10 × 14 / 7), shown as the weekly rate. It drives Home's per-muscle fill and the "what's missing" ranking, i.e. how many days of silence turn a fed muscle into a gap. Sub-claims: (a) 14 d is long enough that a muscle trained once a week is not a gap on the morning of its own session; (b) 14 d is short enough that a muscle silent for the whole window has genuinely missed its dose, because measurable loss of the adaptation begins around or after two weeks without stimulus. Replaces the ungrounded 42 d / 60.
**Searched:** 2026-09-03 · **Verdict:** partially supported — the *band* is supported at both edges (must exceed one weekly rhythm; must stay under the ~3-week strength-retention limit); the *value* 14 inside it is a convention, because no study tests a 14-day accounting window and the per-session anabolic signal the brief assumed lasts "5–7 days" actually ends in 1–2 days
**Number to use:** 8–21 days — default **14**. Volume-equated, once a week per muscle matches two to five times a week in trained men, so a muscle 7 days silent is not under-dosed and the window must be longer than a week; strength holds for 2–3 weeks of complete cessation and the earliest measured tissue change in trained lifters is at 14 days, so a window past ~21 days would hide real loss. 14 is the only whole-week value in that band, makes one missed weekly dose a half-fill and two a gap, and shares a rhythm with the 14-day cardio staleness already grounded.

#### Evidence

*(a) Is a muscle trained once a week under-dosed? — the lower edge*

- `[literature]` When weekly volume is equated, training frequency "does not significantly or meaningfully impact muscle hypertrophy"; a modest effect favouring higher frequency appears only in studies where higher frequency also meant more sets. Systematic review + meta-analysis, 25 studies, mixed training status with a resistance-trained sub-analysis — [Schoenfeld, Grgic & Krieger 2019, J Sports Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/) (PMID 30558493, verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Same for strength: effect sizes climb 0.74 → 0.82 → 0.93 → 1.08 from 1 to 4+ sessions/week, but "when the volume is equated, there was no significant effect of RT frequency on muscular strength gains" (p = 0.421). Systematic review + meta-analysis, 22 studies, trained and untrained, young and older — [Grgic et al. 2018, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29470825/) (PMID 29470825, verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The earlier, non-equated pool did find twice a week beats once (ES 0.49 ± 0.08 vs 0.30 ± 0.07, p = 0.002) and concluded "major muscle groups should be trained at least twice a week" — the source of the practitioner rule below; its 2019 successor attributes the gap to volume. Systematic review + meta-analysis, 10 studies — [Schoenfeld, Ogborn & Krieger 2016, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/) (PMID 27102172, verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` In trained men, 1 session/muscle/week (16 sets in one go) vs 2 sessions/week (8 + 8), volume equated: no difference in 1RM squat, 1RM bench, or thickness of elbow flexors, elbow extensors or quadriceps after 8 weeks. RCT, 20 trained men (10 / 10) — [Brigatto et al. 2019, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29528962/) (PMID 29528962, verified via eutils)

- `[literature]` The counter-case is *not* volume-equated: 1×/week split vs 3×/week total-body in well-trained men grew forearm flexors more at 3× with no strength difference — the higher-frequency arm also did the sets on more days. RCT, 20 well-trained men (10 / 10), 8 weeks — [Schoenfeld et al. 2015, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25932981/) (PMID 25932981, verified via eutils).

- `[literature]` In untrained subjects with volume matched, 1×/week and 3×/week both grew the quadriceps; strength gain was larger at 3× (65.2 vs 43.5 % MVC). Frequency buys strength (a skill) in novices even when it buys no size.

*(c) When does a silent muscle start losing what it built? — the upper edge*

- `[literature]` Training cessation reduces every component of muscular performance — submaximal strength SMD −0.62, maximal force −0.46, maximal power −0.20 — with "a dose-response relationship between the amplitude of SMD and the duration of training cessation"; the effect is larger over 65 y and in inactive people. The abstract does not give duration strata and the full text is paywalled, so no day-threshold is quoted from it.

- `[literature]` The only systematic review restricted to detraining after resistance training could pool just 2 of 20 trials; strength stayed above control at 16–24 weeks of detraining and not at 32–48; "there was not enough data to conduct a meta-analysis on muscular hypertrophy" and "no sufficient high-quality evidence to make any unbiased claim about how long changes in muscle strength … last".

*(d) The roster*

- `[practitioner consensus]` Train each muscle at least twice a week. Israetel (RP chest guide, his byline): "most individuals can recover from chest training at a timecourse that allows for 2–4 sessions of chest per week", justified by a "24–48 hour increase in muscle growth" after a session, so training less often than every 2–4 days means "missing out"; RP quad guide: 2–5 sessions/week and "higher frequency programs, at least in the short term, have shown to generate more muscle growth than needlessly lower ones". Galpin (Huberman guest series pt 2): "train hypertrophy about every 48 hours". Huberman (via Galpin): "a generally good frequency for muscle building is twice per week per muscle group". Held by Israetel, Galpin, Huberman — [RP chest guide](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/chest-hypertrophy-training-tips), [RP quad guide](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/quad-hypertrophy-training-tips), [Galpin, guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/), [Huberman Lab AI answer](https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/6ZP6Hz6m). **The volume-equated literature contradicts this at the outcome level** (Schoenfeld 2019, Grgic 2018, Brigatto, Gomes) — the consensus rests on Israetel's 24–48 h mechanism and on the non-equated 2016 pool, so it is reported as a practitioner position, not settled science.
- `[single-practitioner position]` Frequency is secondary to weekly volume: "the most important consideration is how many times per week / total volume of muscle group per week you are training a muscle group — target 10 working sets per muscle group, per week"; "you can train muscles every day — it comes down to volume". Galpin only; Israetel ranks frequency as a lever in its own right — [Galpin, guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/)
- `[single-practitioner position]` Frequency scales with volume: 1–2×/week per muscle at 5–10 sets/week, 2–3× at 10–20, 3–4+× at 20+, with "no minimum required rest period — even 24 hours between sessions works if volume per session is modest", and roughly 10–11 productive sets per muscle per session. RP staff page (Milo Wolf), not a roster member; Israetel's own guides give 2–4 without the volume ladder — [RP "11-set rule" page](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/podcasts/training-frequency-decoded-the-11-set-rule-every-lifter-should-know)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No roster member gives a day count for when a silent muscle starts to lose size. Israetel: "if you go to five days a week training to four days a week training, you will lose zero muscle and strength" (gym days, not per muscle) — [Israetel video, quoted at FitnessVolt 2024](https://fitnessvolt.com/exercise-scientist-training-frequency/); RP staff (Trevor Fullbright, not a roster member): "You won't lose muscle in two weeks" — [RP burnout survival guide](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/the-burnout-survival-guide). Galpin and Attia are silent on the timing (searched 2026-09-03). Nobody in the roster holds 14 days, 42 days, or any window as an accounting unit — the window exists only in Tekiō.

#### Where they split

**1. "Frequency matters" vs "volume-equated frequency doesn't."** Israetel builds the 2–4×/week rule on the 24–48 h anabolic window (train again before it closes); Dankel 2017 makes the same argument for trained lifters; Schoenfeld 2016's non-equated pool and the split-vs-total-body trials (Schoenfeld 2015, Zaroni 2019) look like support. Against them, the two largest reviews (Schoenfeld 2019, 25 studies; Grgic 2018, 22 studies) and both trained-men volume-equated trials (Brigatto 2019, Gomes 2019) find that once weekly sets are held constant, once a week per muscle matches two to five times. Galpin straddles it — "every 48 hours" as a preference, "it comes down to volume" as the rule. The mechanism and the outcome disagree because the anabolic window (24–48 h; 28 h trained) is far shorter than any practical frequency: even Israetel's 2–4 sessions leave the muscle "unsignalled" most of the week, so the signal's duration cannot be what sets the dose. **What this forces on Tekiō:** a rolling window that *sums sets* is frequency-blind by construction — it sides with the volume-equated literature, and that is the right side for a "have I fed this muscle" read. Do not shrink the window to 7 days to enforce frequency: that reintroduces the leg-day-morning artefact and calls a fully dosed once-a-week muscle a gap, which Brigatto and Gomes say it is not. If Peter wants the practitioner side (reward spreading, warn on a 7+-day gap), that is a *recency* signal — `daysSince` / `RECOVER_DAYS` already exist — layered on the fill, not a shorter window. Two questions, two reads (P2).

**2. What "too long" means: strength, whole muscle, or fibre.** The retention literature gives three different clocks — type II fibre area moves by 14 days (Hortobágyi), strength holds to ~3–4 weeks (McMaster, Mujika, Hwang), whole-muscle CSA in novices tolerates 3 weeks (Ogasawara) and is clearly lost by 10 (Halonen). No practitioner picks one. **The design choice:** which clock ends the window. 14 (fibre) is the strict choice; 21 (strength) the lenient one. Both are inside the evidence; 42 is outside it. Tekiō's read exists to say what is missing, so the stricter clock is the honest default; 21 would show a fortnight of silence as a one-third fill.

The three §6.6 candidates, ruled on: **7 d ÷ 10** — the literature's unit for the *rate*, wrong as a *window* (a muscle 7 days silent is not under-dosed, and it flips to zero on session morning). **Calendar week-to-date** — same flaw, worse on Monday; and no evidence uses calendar weeks. **42 d ÷ 60** — beyond every retention limit found (3–4 weeks); it would let three weeks of silence read as half-fed. **14 d ÷ 20** — the shortest whole-week window longer than one weekly rhythm; the first missed weekly dose halves the fill, the second empties it, and that second week is where the earliest measured loss sits.

#### Caveats

- Population mismatch: the volume-equated frequency trials in trained men are small (Brigatto n = 20, Gomes n = 23) and 8 weeks long; the 14-day detraining data come from 12 power athletes (Hortobágyi) and 20 trained men (Hwang); the 3-week-gap trials (Ogasawara) and the 10-week-break trial (Halonen) are untrained. Bosquet finds the cessation effect larger only past 65 y, and Bickel's maintenance failure is at 60–75 y, so a trained 40-year-old sits with the young-trained data, with a small age discount on the upper edge (lean toward 14, not 21).
- The brief's premise that the MPS response takes "~5–7 days" to return to baseline is not what the literature shows: 36 h (MacDougall), 48 h (Phillips), 28 h in the trained state (Tang). The window is therefore not modelling the anabolic signal; it is a schedule tolerance bounded below by the once-a-week equivalence and above by detraining onset. The source comment should say so, or a later reader will "correct" 14 toward 2.
- Detraining studies measure *all* training stopping. A muscle silent while the rest of the body trains is a different state (systemic hormones, general activity, sport) and no study measures it; the local read extrapolates.
- Sport is invisible to the sum. Peter's quads and shoulders get tennis stimulus that never logs as a set, so a 14-day window will call some muscles gaps that are fed off-ledger — the honest fix is logging or a sport-to-muscle credit, not a longer window.
- The per-session cap: a once-a-week muscle at 10 hard sets is at RP's ~10–11 productive sets per session; a lifter trying to reach 20 in 14 days in *one* session is past it. The window does not know how the sets were spread — that is the frequency question the fill deliberately ignores (split 1).
- The deload week now halves every muscle's fill for a week; 42's only merit was averaging it away. That is a program concern, not a read concern (Peter, 2026-09-03), but Home will look emptier in deload weeks and should say why.
- The window is 20 sets *or* 10/wk shown; with 14 days the target is exact. If `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR` moves (S3's 10–20 band), the 20 moves with it; the days do not.
- What would move this number: a trial spacing a muscle at 10–14-day intervals in trained adults with muscle-size outcomes (would fix the upper edge directly — none exists); evidence that whole-muscle size falls inside 10 days in trained lifters (would pull the default to 10); an RIR or sport-credit capture (would change the numerator, not the window); a decision to read the muscle map as "optimal" rather than "adequate" (010) would raise the target, not the days.

#### Source comment
```
// 14 — MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS: rolling window for the per-muscle hard-set fill (target = WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × 14 / 7 = 20).
// Honest band 8–21 d. Lower edge: volume-equated, 1×/wk per muscle matches 2–5×/wk in trained men (Schoenfeld 2019,
// Grgic 2018, Brigatto 2019, Gomes 2019), so a muscle 7 d silent is not under-dosed and the window must exceed one
// weekly rhythm. Upper edge: strength holds ~3–4 wk without training (McMaster 2013, Mujika 2001, Hwang 2017) and the
// earliest measured tissue loss in trained lifters is at 14 d (Hortobágyi 1993, type II fibre area −6.4 %). 14 is a
// convention inside that band — whole weeks, one missed weekly dose = half fill, one rhythm with QUALITY_STALENESS_DAYS.
// Not an MPS window: the per-session signal ends in 28–48 h (Tang 2008, Phillips 1997). The sum is frequency-blind by
// design; recency lives in daysSince / RECOVER_DAYS. See docs/roadmap/039-adaptations-read-grounding.md#grounding
```

**Decision (S12, 2026-09-03):** `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS = 14` ships, unchanged
from the value handed to the scout, labelled a **convention inside a grounded
band (8–21 d)**. Target `MUSCLE_SET_TARGET = 20`. Three things the run
settled beyond the value: the fill is *frequency-blind by design* (the
volume-equated literature's side — a once-a-week muscle at its dose is not a
gap), recency stays a separate read in `daysSince` / `RECOVER_DAYS` rather
than a shorter window, and the window is a schedule tolerance, not a
muscle-protein-synthesis window — the "5–7 day MPS" premise came from the
dispatch prompt, not the literature, and is dropped. The deload dip on Home
is accepted as a program concern; the sheet names the window so the reader
can see why. 42 days is outside every retention limit found and goes.

### S4 — ADAPTATIONS[power].rx and KEYWORD_ADAPTATION (what makes a set a power set)

**Claim:** A power set is trained at **30–70 % 1RM**, **1–5 reps** with explosive intent, **3–5 sets**, **2–5 min** full rest, **never to fatigue**, and is what jumps, throws and Olympic lifts are (`rx`, row 3.3); and any exercise whose name contains one of 20 substrings (`sprint, dash, agility, pogo, clean, snatch, jerk, box jump, broad jump, jump squat, jump, plyo, throw, med ball, medicine ball, slam, kettlebell swing, kb swing, sled, hop`) is a power set **regardless of rep count** and counts in `byQuality.power` only (row 2.6, per S3). Drives which logged sets land on the per-muscle power map instead of the hard-set total, and the prescription text the user reads before a power session.
**Searched:** 2026-09-03 · **Verdict:** partially supported — reps, sets, rest and "never to fatigue" **supported**; the 30–70 % load band **partially supported** (a defensible pooled range that hides three exercise-specific optima); 17 of the 20 keywords **supported**, `sled` **partially supported**, `agility` **convention only**; two substrings (`hop`, `jump`) collide with non-power exercise names; and the rule's *exclusivity* ("power and nothing else") is **not supported** for high-rep kettlebell swings.
**Number to use:** field by field —
- **load:** keep `30–70% 1RM` as the headline (it is the 2026 ACSM position-stand range and Galpin's), but the honest statement is exercise-specific: **jumps and throws 0–30 %, squat/bench-type lifts 30–70 %, Olympic lifts 70–90 %** (Soriano 2015/2017, Cormie 2011). Default: `30–70% 1RM (jumps & throws lighter, Olympic lifts heavier)`.
- **reps:** `1–5` for barbell, Olympic and loaded-jump sets is supported (NSCA 1–2 / 3–5; Galpin 3–5); jump and throw sets in the located trials ran **3–8** contacts. Default: `1–5 (lifts) · 3–8 (jumps, throws), explosive intent`.
- **sets:** `3–5` — supported; the literature's actual ceiling is **≤ 24 total reps per session** (ACSM 2026), which 3–5 × 1–5 sits inside. Unchanged.
- **rest:** `2–5 min` — supported; ≥ 2 min preserves power output and 3 min = 5 min. Unchanged.
- **effort:** `Never to fatigue` — supported; the measured line is **≈ ≤ 20 % velocity loss in the set**. Default: `Never to fatigue — stop when the reps slow`.
- **cue:** supported (Behm & Sale on intent; ACSM 2026 on Olympic lifts and fast concentrics). Unchanged apart from carrying the load split.
- **keywords:** keep 18, fix 2 collisions (`hop` matches "chop"/"woodchop"; `jump` matches "jump rope"/"jumping jacks" — add exclusions or exact tokens), keep `sled` and `agility` as **labelled conventions**, and record that a kettlebell-swing set of ≥ 16 reps is the one case where "a power set is never near failure" is false — see *Where they split* 3.

#### Evidence

*(a) Load — is 30–70 % one band or three?*

- `[literature]` Lower body: the load that maximises power is exercise-specific — squat **> 30 to < 70 % 1RM**, jump squat **≤ 30 %**, power clean / hang power clean **≥ 70 %**. A single band is therefore a costume on three facts. Meta-analysis, 27 studies, 468 subjects, 5,766 effect sizes — [Soriano et al. 2015, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26063470/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Upper body: bench press **> 30 to < 70 %**, bench press throw **< 30 %**; heterogeneity I² > 75 %. Meta-analysis, 11 studies, 434 subjects, 7,680 effect sizes — [Soriano, Suchomel & Marín 2017, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27699699/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The pooled range the app prints is nonetheless the position-stand number: "Power was enhanced by moderate loads (30 %–70 % one repetition maximum), low-to-moderate volume (≤ 24 repetitions·sets), Olympic-style weightlifting, and power RT (fast concentric phase)." No rest interval is given for power. Overview of 137 systematic reviews, > 30,000 participants — [ACSM Position Stand, Currier et al. 2026, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41843416/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The previous stand split the light-load strategy by region: **0–60 % 1RM lower body, 30–60 % upper body**, fast contraction velocity, **3–5 sets, 3–5 min rest**, alongside heavy strength work. Position stand — [ACSM 2009, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19204579/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The training-methods review behind most textbook prescriptions: ballistic exercises at **0–50 % 1RM**, weightlifting movements at **50–90 % 1RM** ("the most potent loading stimulus"), plyometrics matched to the sport's stretch rates — three families, three load bands.

Narrative review — [Kawamori & Haff 2004, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15320680/) (PMID verified via eutils; abstract gives no numbers)
- `[literature]` Heavy strength work trains power too, in the not-yet-strong: 10 weeks of back squats at 75–90 % 1RM vs maximal-effort jump squats at 0–30 % gave the same jump peak-power gain (+17.7 vs +17.6 %) and 40 m sprint gain (+2.2 vs +3.6 %, ns), while only the squat group got strong (1RM +31.2 vs +4.5 %).

*(b) Reps, sets, rest*

- `[literature]` The lineage of "1–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 2–5 min": the NSCA textbook table gives power **single-effort 80–90 % 1RM, 1–2 reps; multiple-effort 75–85 % 1RM, 3–5 reps; both 3–5 sets, 2–5 min rest**. Note the loads: NSCA's rows are Olympic-lift-shaped (75–90 %), so the app has fused NSCA's reps/sets/rest with ACSM's/Galpin's 30–70 % load — two sources, one card. Textbook (expert-consensus tier, not a study) — [NSCA Essentials ch. 17 table, as transcribed](https://www.ptpioneer.com/personal-training/certifications/nsca-cscs/cscs-chapter-17/)
- `[literature]` Reps per set in ballistic training scale with load: the jump-squat arm trained from **4 × 3 at 60 % 1RM to 8 × 6 at 0 %**; the swing arm did 12 × 30 s on / 30 s off with 12–16 kg. RCT, 21 healthy men 18–27 y, 6 weeks, 2×/wk — [Lake & Lauder 2012, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22580981/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Two minutes is enough between ballistic sets: 5 × 8 bench-press throws at 40 % 1RM with 1, 2 or 3 min rest — 1 min produced larger power drops and higher physiological/perceptual strain; **2 min = 3 min**.

- `[literature]` Three minutes is enough for bar speed on loaded lifts: 3 × 5 at 10RM in squat and bench, 1 vs 3 vs 5 min — 1 min slowed sets 2–3 and cut F₀ and Pmax; **3 min = 5 min**.

- `[literature]` Power's dose is counted in contacts, not sets: minimal effective jump-training dose ≈ **92 weekly jumps** (youth athletes — population mismatch).

*(c) "Never to fatigue" and "maximal intent"*

- `[literature]` Intent is the stimulus: 16 weeks of *attempted* ballistic contractions produced the same high-velocity-specific gain (+38 % peak torque at 5.23 rad/s, +26 % rate of torque development) whether the limb actually moved fast or was held isometric. Within-subject (one limb each), 16 university students (8 M / 8 F), 3×/wk, 5 × 10 — [Behm & Sale 1993, J Appl Physiol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8444715/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Fatigue inside the set costs power: four velocity-loss thresholds (0 / 10 / 20 / 40 %) at 70–85 % 1RM, 3 sets, 4 min rest — only VL20 and VL40 grew muscle, but **VL40 reduced early rate of force development** and slowed muscle contractile delay; "moderate VL thresholds should be chosen".

*(d) The keywords, family by family*

- `[literature]` **Kettlebell swing → power: supported.** Swing peak and mean power exceeded back-squat power and were "largely comparable with jump squat power"; net impulse with 32 kg (276 N·s) beat the 40 % 1RM jump squat (231) and 60 % back squat (183). Lab cross-sectional, 16 men — [Lake & Lauder 2012, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22207261/) (PMID verified via eutils). Six weeks of swings raised vertical jump **+19.8 %** and half-squat 1RM +9.8 % — RCT, 21 men — [Lake & Lauder 2012 (training)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22580981/). Swings (3 × 6 + 4 × 4 accelerated) matched high pulls + power cleans for vertical jump; weightlifting won on strength — RCT, 30 men (13 / 17), 6 weeks — [Otto et al. 2012, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22344061/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` **…but a high-rep swing set is not *only* a power set.** Six weeks of 20 kg swings improved jump height +8.7–10.1 %, 1RM +7.8–8.7 % **and muscular endurance +23.8 %**. RCT, 28 HIFT practitioners (11 / 11 / 6 control) — [Junior et al. 2022, Int J Exerc Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35518365/) (PMID verified via eutils). Tabata-style swings (8 × 20 s / 10 s) for 8 weeks did **not** improve sprint performance — RCT, 18 recreationally active women (8 / 10) — [Holmstrup et al. 2016, Int J Exerc Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27766131/) (PMID verified via eutils). Swings done as intervals train endurance as much as power, and the keyword cannot see which was done.
- `[literature]` **Sled → partially supported.** Resisted-sled *sprinting* improves acceleration (ES 0.61, p = 0.0001) but not maximal velocity; recommended > 160 m per session, 2–3×/wk, ≥ 6 weeks. Systematic review + meta-analysis, 13 studies, 32 RST groups / 15 control — [Alcaraz et al. 2018, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29926369/) (PMID verified via eutils). Peak power in sled sprinting is reached at **78–82 % body mass** (optimal 69–96 % by friction) at 4.2–4.9 m/s — still a run. Lab, 27 athletes (12 recreational / 15 sprinters) — [Cross et al. 2017, Int J Sports Physiol Perform](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28051333/) (PMID verified via eutils). A heavy prowler push at walking pace for distance is outside both studies; the substring `sled` cannot tell a sprint from a march.
- `[literature]` **Sprint / dash → supported.** Sprint time is treated as a power outcome and responds to both jump-squat and heavy-squat training (Cormie 2010 above); sled work is modelled as a force–velocity–power profile (Cross 2017/2018 above). The app's 2026-08-29 move of sprints from `speed` to `power` is the literature's own bookkeeping.
- `[literature]` **Agility → convention only.** Agility is "a rapid whole-body movement with change of velocity or direction *in response to a stimulus*", with cognitive components (scanning, anticipation) as well as strength, power and technique. Narrative review — [Sheppard & Young 2006, J Sports Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16882626/) (PMID verified via eutils). Resistance training does improve change-of-direction speed (SMD −0.82; adults −0.63), so COD has a strength/power component — Systematic review + meta-analysis, 15 studies / 19 groups — [Chaabene et al. 2020, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451922/) (PMID verified via eutils). But an "agility" entry in a gym log is usually ladder or cone drills — coordination at low force — and no study credits those to a muscle's power.
- `[literature]` **Throw / med ball / medicine ball / slam → supported.** Adding rotational and full-body medicine-ball work 3×/wk for 12 weeks roughly doubled torso rotational strength gains (17.1 / 18.3 % vs 10.5 / 10.2 %) and the hitter's-throw gain (10.6 vs 3.0 %). RCT, 49 high-school baseball players (15.4 y) — [Szymanski et al. 2007, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17685676/) (PMID verified via eutils). Twelve weeks of medicine-ball training raised bench- and shoulder-press power at 30 and 50 % 1RM vs control; throw tests correlated with power tests more than with 1RM. RCT, 21 female handball players (16.9 y) — [Ignjatovic et al. 2012, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22027860/) (PMID verified via eutils). No trial isolates the *slam*; it is a downward throw and is credited by extension.
- `[literature]` **Clean / snatch / jerk → supported** (Soriano 2015: cleans peak power ≥ 70 %; Cormie 2011: weightlifting 50–90 %; ACSM 2026: "Olympic-style weightlifting" enhances power; Otto 2012). **Box jump / broad jump / jump squat / jump / plyo / pogo / hop → supported** (Cormie 2010: jump squats 0–30 %; Cormie 2011: plyometrics; Ramirez-Campillo 2023, both reviews cited in S3).
- `[practitioner consensus]` Power is quality work, non-fatiguing, programmed apart from volume; strength underpins it ("power = strength × speed" — Galpin; "having a strength foundation is a MUST" — Israetel). Held by Galpin and Israetel; the literature (Cormie 2010, Pareja-Blanco, Jukic) does not contradict — [Galpin, Huberman Lab guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/), [RP, Dr Israetel blog preview](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/dr-israetel-blog-preview)
- `[single-practitioner position]` The app's card, nearly verbatim: "30–70 % 1RM", "3–5 exercises, 3–5 reps × 3–5 sets, 3–5 min rest, 3–5 days/week", "true speed work by definition is non-fatiguing — high rest, low fatigue, trying to reach a new velocity", exercises "plyo, med ball throws, short sprints, air bike, snatch, clean and jerk, clapping push-ups, jump squats, kettlebell swings". Galpin only. In the earlier solo episode his band was **40–70 % "plus or minus"** — same person, two numbers — [guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/), [episode 65 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/episode-65-dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-endurance-huberman-lab/), [hubermanlab.com episode page](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-and-endurance)
- `[single-practitioner position]` "Power training is like the tuning of a car. Power training works best for people who are already strong, and makes them just a bit better … some very good research shows that strength training improves power MORE THAN POWER TRAINING for athletes that are not already VERY strong" (his marker: ~2× body-weight squat). Israetel only; Galpin prescribes power as a standalone quality for everyone; Cormie 2010 is the research he means — [RP, Dr Israetel blog preview](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/dr-israetel-blog-preview)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No power pillar: Attia's training model is four pillars — zone 2, VO₂max, strength, stability — with power folded into strength and no separate prescription. Attia only, silent rather than opposed — [The Drive #261 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/the-drive-with-dr-peter-attia/training-for-the-centenarian-decathlon-zone-2-vo2-max-stability-and-strength-the-drive-with-peter-attia-261/)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No roster member, no position stand and no located study holds the 20-substring list as such. It is Galpin's exercise list turned into string matching; the list is defensible, the matching is a code convention.

#### Where they split

Three forks; the first is real, the other two are Tekiō's.

**1. Is power a standalone quality for a not-very-strong lifter, or a tuning layer on strength?** Galpin programs power for everyone as its own adaptation with its own card; Israetel says below ~2× body-weight squat, heavy strength work *is* the power training, and the literature he points at exists (Cormie 2010: squats at 75–90 % grew jump power as much as jump squats in weak men). ACSM 2026 sits between them — "power RT" and "Olympic-style weightlifting" both enhance power, with no strength prerequisite stated. The decision this forces: **does a heavy strength set feed the power map?** Under §6.0 and S3 the answer is no (power fills only via keyword or override) — that is Galpin's bookkeeping, and it is the right one for a *"what's missing"* read, because velocity work is the thing that silently disappears from a lifter's week; Cormie's result means the *penalty* for a missing power map is smaller than the map implies for someone who squats heavy. Keep Galpin's bookkeeping; say on the sheet that heavy strength sets also build power in the not-yet-strong. Do not credit strength sets to power at some fraction — nobody holds that number.

**2. One load band or three.** Every source that gives one number gives 30–70 % (ACSM 2026, Galpin); every source that measures gives three (Soriano ×2, Cormie 2011). The app must choose between a *training range* (the position stand's pooled statement, easy to read) and an *exercise-specific optimum* (what the meta-analyses actually found). Keep the headline and add the split in words — the user picks a load per exercise, not per adaptation, and "30–70 %" sends him to jump with a 50 % bar on his back.

**3. Keyword exclusivity vs the high-rep swing.** S3 excluded power sets from the hard-set total on the premise that "a jump, throw or swing set is never near failure". For jumps, throws and Olympic lifts that holds. For kettlebell swings at 15–20+ reps it does not: Junior 2022 measured a 23.8 % endurance gain and a 1RM gain from a fixed-load swing protocol, and Israetel's landmark model would count a 20-rep swing set at 0–4 RIR as a working set. The rule as written makes such a set **one power set and nothing else**. Tekiō must choose: (a) keep the keyword exclusive (simple, conservative, consistent with S3 and with the fact that the app cannot see effort), or (b) let reps add a second tag for ballistic sets above the endurance edge (a ≥ 16-rep swing counts in `power` *and* `muscular_endurance`, still 0 toward the hard-set total). Default **(a)**, labelled — no study gives the fraction, an RIR field would make (b) honest, and today it affects one exercise family. The dishonest option is to leave it unlabelled.

#### Caveats

- Population mismatch: the load meta-analyses pool young trained men and athletes (Soriano: 468 and 434 subjects); Cormie 2010 is 24 "relatively weak" men; the velocity-loss trials are young resistance-trained men (n = 22, 64); the swing trials are young men or recreationally active women (n = 18–30); the medicine-ball RCTs are adolescents (n = 21, 49); the sled work is athletes (n = 27). **No located trial is in 40-year-old recreational lifters**, and no located primary source in this run quantifies how power declines with age — third-party pages claim ~2× the rate of strength, but none of that was verified here, so it is not in the block.
- The user cannot act on "% 1RM" for a kettlebell or a jump: he has no 1RM for the implement and logs no velocity. For those sets the actionable rule is the cue ("light enough to move fast, stop when the reps slow"), not the load band. `% 1RM` is only actionable on barbell lifts he has a max for.
- The app cannot see fatigue or velocity; "never to fatigue" is assumed for every keyword set. That assumption is safe for jumps, throws and cleans and unsafe for swings and sled pushes done as conditioning (fork 3). Tennis sessions — his most frequent power expression — are logged as cardio/sport and never reach this rule at all.
- `hop` is a substring of "chop" / "woodchop" (a cable-chop set would silently become a power set and leave the hard-set total); `jump` matches "jump rope" and "jumping jacks" (conditioning, not power); `agility` matches ladder drills. Two of these are bugs in the matcher, not in the model. Whether any logged exercise name currently collides was not checked (read-only run, no DB access).
- The two rx fields with a lineage problem are reps/sets/rest (NSCA's 75–90 % rows) and load (ACSM's/Galpin's 30–70 %): the card is a splice of two prescriptions written for different exercises. It still reads correctly for a mixed power session, but the attribution line on the reference card ("Based on the Huberman Lab × Galpin guest series") should become "ACSM 2026 position stand; Galpin's protocol matches" for this block.
- What would move this number: an RIR or velocity field (would make fork 3's option (b) honest and let swings be credited to endurance when trained that way); a power-training trial in 35–50-year-old recreational lifters with per-muscle outcomes (would ground the per-muscle map's claim rather than its inputs); a Soriano-style meta-analysis of *longitudinal* power gains by training load (would say whether training at the optimal load beats training across the spectrum — Cormie 2011 argues the spectrum, no meta-analysis settles it); a check of the exercise table for the `hop`/`jump`/`agility` collisions.

#### Source comment
```
// rx.power — 30–70 % 1RM is the pooled position-stand range (ACSM 2026, Currier) and Galpin's; the
// measured optima are exercise-specific: jumps/throws ≤30 %, squat/bench 30–70 %, cleans ≥70 %
// (Soriano 2015, 2017; Cormie 2011). Reps 1–5 / sets 3–5 / rest 2–5 min are NSCA's power rows
// (written for 75–90 % lifts); ≥2 min rest preserves power (Hernández Davó 2016, de Salles 2009),
// ≤24 reps·sets/session (ACSM 2026). "Never to fatigue" ≈ ≤20 % velocity loss (Pareja-Blanco 2017,
// 2020; Jukic 2023); intent is the stimulus (Behm & Sale 1993).
// See docs/roadmap/039-adaptations-read-grounding.md#grounding

// KEYWORD_ADAPTATION — Galpin's power exercise list as substrings. Jumps/plyo/Olympic lifts/throws/

// convention (Sheppard & Young 2006). A ≥16-rep swing set also trains endurance (Junior 2022) — the
// rule counts it as power only, by decision (039 S4 fork 3). `hop` also matches "chop", `jump` also

```

**Decision (S4, 2026-09-03):** no number moves; the block gains the split the
meta-analyses found and two labels. `rx` load reads
`30–70% 1RM (jumps & throws lighter, Olympic lifts heavier)`, reps
`1–5 (lifts) · 3–8 (jumps, throws), explosive intent`, effort
`Never to fatigue — stop when the reps slow`; sets, rest and cue unchanged.
Fork 1: heavy strength sets do **not** feed the power map (Galpin's
bookkeeping, S3's rule) — the one-line "heavy strength also builds power in the
not-yet-strong" note is 031's to draw on the sheet. Fork 2: one headline band,
split in words. Fork 3: the keyword rule stays **exclusive** — a ≥16-rep swing
set is one power set and nothing else, labelled a decision in the source
comment; an RIR field is the upgrade path. `sled` and `agility` stay on the
list as labelled conventions. The matcher collision is real: a DB check the
same day found **Cable Woodchop** matching `hop`, so its sets read as power
and leave the hard-set total today — fixed in the S4 code unit (§6.7,
v1.16.1), where `clapping` also joined the list: Galpin's list names clapping
push-ups, [043](done/043-scout-named-exercises-catalogue.md) put the exercise
in the catalogue, and no other keyword caught it. The
NSCA textbook line is tier-6 expert consensus with its tier named inline; the
tag vocabulary has no slot for a professional body's table, so it stays as
delivered. The reference card's single attribution line stays until S10
closes, when all seven blocks have provenance.

### S5 — ADAPTATIONS[strength].rx and the "3–5 rule" cue (what a strength set is prescribed as)

**Claim:** A strength set is trained at **85–100 % 1RM**, **3–5 reps**, **3–5 sets**, **2–5 min** full rest, stopping **1–2 reps shy of failure**; and the cue names "Galpin's 3–5 rule: 3–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 3–5 min rest, ~3–5×/week" as the way to do it (`rx`, row 3.4). Drives the prescription text the user reads before a strength session; the *classification* of a logged set (`repRange [1, 5]`, row 2.1) is S11's and untouched here.
**Searched:** 2026-09-03 · **Verdict:** supported — load, sets, rest and effort each sit inside a band the position stands and meta-analyses give; reps 3–5 is a practical sub-band of the literature's 1–6 RM; the cue is a named `[single-practitioner position]` whose five parts the literature supports piecewise, so it stays **with attribution** (acceptance box 3).
**Number to use:** field by field —
- **load:** the literature's line is **≥ 80 % 1RM** (ACSM 2026; Currier 2023 network meta-analysis); the card's `85–100 %` is the floor that 3–5 reps at 1–2 RIR implies (a 6–7 RM ≈ 83–87 %; NSCA's strength row is >85 % for <6 reps). Default: unchanged, with the ≥ 80 % line in the source comment.
- **reps:** `3–5` — inside ACSM 2009's heavy-loading emphasis of **1–6 RM** and Schoenfeld 2021's 1–5-rep "strength zone"; singles and doubles are left out by Galpin's practical choice, not by evidence. Unchanged.
- **sets:** `3–5` — ACSM 2026 found strength enhanced by **2–3 sets per exercise**; more weekly sets per exercise give more strength in a graded way (Ralston 2017). Unchanged.
- **rest:** `2–5 min` — **> 2 min** is what maximises strength in trained lifters (Grgic 2018 review); 3–5 min in ACSM 2009 and de Salles 2009. Unchanged.
- **effort:** `1–2 reps shy of failure` — proximity to failure has a **negligible** relationship with strength gain across the RIR range (Robinson 2024); failure vs non-failure is a wash or slightly favours non-failure (Grgic 2022, Davies 2016, Vieira 2021). The honest band is "not to failure"; 1–2 RIR is a default inside it. Unchanged.
- **cue:** keep, attributed — Galpin's "3 to 5" heuristic (Huberman Lab guest series part 2, 2023; first stated on episode 65, 2022). The days-per-week element is a whole-body session count, and frequency acts on strength through volume (Grgic 2018), so it is the one part that is convention rather than finding.

#### Evidence

*(a) Load — how heavy is "strength"?*

- `[literature]` "Voluntary strength was enhanced by lifting heavier loads (**≥ 80 % one-repetition maximum**), through a complete range of motion, for **2–3 sets**, at the beginning of training sessions, and **≥ 2 sessions/wk**"; training to momentary muscle fatigue "did not consistently impact training outcomes". Overview of 137 systematic reviews, > 30,000 participants — [ACSM Position Stand, Currier et al. 2026, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41843416/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S4)
- `[literature]` Higher-load (**> 80 % 1RM**) prescriptions maximised strength gains; higher-load, multi-set, thrice-weekly training was the top-ranked prescription (SMD 1.60, 95 % CrI 1.38–1.82 vs control). Bayesian network meta-analysis, 178 studies, n = 5,097 (45 % women) — [Currier et al. 2023, Br J Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37414459/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` For intermediate-to-advanced lifters: a periodised 1–12 RM range "with eventual emphasis on **heavy loading (1–6 RM)** using **3- to 5-min rest** periods"; frequency 3–4 d/wk intermediate, 4–5 d/wk advanced. Position stand — [ACSM 2009, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19204579/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S4)
- `[literature]` 1RM gains significantly greater with high-load (> 60 % 1RM) than low-load (≤ 60 %) training, all sets to failure; isometric strength and hypertrophy no different. Meta-analysis, 21 studies — [Schoenfeld, Grgic, Ogborn & Krieger 2017, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28834797/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Strength gain: high load (≤ 8 RM) and moderate load (9–15 RM) both beat low load (> 15 RM) — SMD 0.60–0.63 and 0.34–0.35 — with high vs moderate favouring high but not significant (SMD 0.26–0.28, p = 0.068). Network meta-analysis, 28 studies, 747 healthy adults, sets to volitional failure — [Lopez et al. 2021, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33433148/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Even with volume load matched, **≥ 80 % 1RM (≤ 7 RM)** beat both moderate (60–79 %) and low (30–59 %) loads for 1RM strength, and moderate beat low; hypertrophy was load-independent. Meta-analysis — [Carvalho et al. 2022, Appl Physiol Nutr Metab](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35015560/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` The "strength zone" is **1–5 reps at 80–100 % 1RM** for 1RM outcomes (pooled ES 0.58 favouring high vs low load, 14 studies); the advantage dissipates when strength is tested isometrically or isokinetically, and low loads (≥ 20 reps) still produce 1RM gains, especially in the untrained. Narrative re-examination of the repetition continuum — [Schoenfeld, Grgic, Van Every & Plotkin 2021, Sports (Basel)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33671664/) (PMID verified via eutils; full text [PMC7927075](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7927075/))
- `[literature]` The NSCA textbook row the card's shape comes from: strength **> 85 % 1RM, < 6 reps, 2–6 sets, 2–5 min rest**; frequency 2–3 / 3–4 / 4–7 sessions/wk by training status. Textbook (expert-consensus tier, not a study) — [NSCA Essentials ch. 17 table, as transcribed](https://www.ptpioneer.com/personal-training/certifications/nsca-cscs/cscs-chapter-17/) (cited in S4)

*(b) Sets, frequency*

- `[literature]` Graded dose–response between weekly sets per exercise and strength: high weekly sets beat low (ES difference 0.18, 95 % CI 0.06–0.30) and medium beat low (0.15, CI 0.01–0.30); for well-trained lifters "either MWS or HWS may be an appropriate dose". Meta-analysis, 9 studies, 61 treatment groups — [Ralston et al. 2017, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28755103/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in 011)
- `[literature]` Strength ES rose with frequency — 0.74 / 0.82 / 0.93 / 1.08 for 1 / 2 / 3 / 4+ sessions/wk — but **volume-equated studies showed no frequency effect** (p = 0.421): frequency is a way to add volume, not a dose in itself. Meta-analysis, 22 studies, mostly untrained — [Grgic et al. 2018, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29470825/) (PMID verified via eutils)

*(c) Rest*

- `[literature]` "Robust gains in muscular strength can be achieved even with short RIs (< 60 s). However, it seems that longer duration RIs (**> 2 min**) are required to maximize strength gains in resistance-trained individuals"; untrained: 60–120 s suffices. Systematic review, 23 studies, 491 participants (413 M / 78 F) — [Grgic, Schoenfeld, Skrepnik, Davies & Mikulic 2018, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28933024/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Resting **3–5 min** between sets at 50–90 % 1RM allowed more reps across sets and, chronically, "greater increases in absolute strength". Narrative review, 35 studies — [de Salles et al. 2009, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691365/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S4)

*(d) Effort — how close to failure?*

- `[literature]` Across the estimated-RIR range, "strength gains were similar across a wide range of RIR" (every best-fit model's slope CI contained the null), while hypertrophy rose as sets ended closer to failure. Exploratory multilevel meta-regressions — [Robinson, Pelland, Remmert et al. 2024, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38970765/) (PMID verified via eutils; DOI verified via Crossref)
- `[literature]` Failure vs non-failure: no difference for strength (ES −0.09, 95 % CI −0.22 to 0.05); when volume was not equated, **non-failure won** (ES −0.32). Meta-analysis, 15 studies, all young adults — [Grgic, Schoenfeld, Orazem & Sabol 2022, J Sport Health Sci](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Non-failure training gave 0.6–1.3 % more strength (small ES 0.34 favouring non-failure, larger for compound lifts and trained participants); "it seems unnecessary to perform failure training to maximise muscular strength". Meta-analysis, 8 studies — [Davies, Orr, Halaki & Hackett 2016, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26666744/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Same result a third time, plus power: strength SMD −0.08 (ns), non-failure ahead when volumes differ (−0.34), and non-failure ahead for **power output** when volumes differ (−0.61). Meta-analysis, 13 studies — [Vieira et al. 2021, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33555822/) (PMID verified via eutils)

*(e) The practitioners, and the cue's provenance*

- `[single-practitioner position]` The "3 to 5" concept, verbatim: "3–5 days per week, choose 3–5 exercises, do 3–5 repetitions per set, 3–5 working sets, rest 3–5 minutes between each set"; strength load "70 % 1RM or higher" in the guest-series notes and "at least 85 % of your one-rep max … typically five or fewer per set" in Huberman Lab's own summary — the same person, two load floors; "you don't have to go to failure to see strength gains". Galpin only; Israetel and Attia do not use the rule — [guest series pt 2 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-grow-muscles-part-2-huberman-lab/), [Huberman Lab "sets and reps for strength"](https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/eE3Mp5Q4), [guest series pt 2 episode page](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-and-grow-muscles), [episode 65 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/episode-65-dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-endurance-huberman-lab/)
- `[single-practitioner position]` Strength is "roughly three to six reps", 5–15 sets per muscle or movement per week, compound lifts that match the test ("deadlifts are an excellent movement"); strength is "moving heavier weights and building neural efficiency" where hypertrophy is "fatigue, pump, and volume". No rest or RIR number given for strength. Israetel only — [RP article, mirrored](https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/26017357-exercise-scientist-explains-size-vs-strength-training)
- `[practitioner consensus]` Strength work is heavy, low-rep, fully rested and stopped short of failure. Held by Galpin and Israetel; Attia trains heavy but publishes no rep scheme (silent); the literature above agrees on every element except that it draws the load line at 80 %, not 85 %.

#### Where they split

No practitioner-vs-practitioner fork of the S4 kind. Four smaller gaps, each between the card and the literature, and each is a decision Tekiō has to name:

**1. 85 or 80.** Every review draws the strength line at **≥ 80 % 1RM**; the card and Galpin's summary say 85. A 5-point gap, not a contradiction: 3–5 reps stopped 1–2 short is a 5–7 RM set, which sits at ≈ 83–87 % on any rep table, so 85 is what the reps and effort fields already imply. Keep 85–100 on the card and write the 80 % line into the source comment, so nobody later "corrects" 85 to 80 and breaks the set the fields describe.

**2. 3–5 or 1–6.** ACSM 2009's heavy emphasis is 1–6 RM and Schoenfeld 2021's zone is 1–5 reps; the card's 3–5 excludes singles, doubles and sixes. That is Galpin's practical rule for a recreational lifter (singles need a spotter and a warm-up ladder), not a finding. Keep 3–5; label it in the comment. The *classification* edge (`repRange [1, 5]`, row 2.1) is S11's and may end up wider than the prescription — that is fine: the prescription says what to do, the band says what counts.

**3. "1–2 reps shy" is more precise than the evidence.** The evidence says *proximity to failure barely matters for strength* and *non-failure is at least as good*. Any RIR from 1 to 3–4 is inside that. 1–2 is a defensible default (heaviest set you can repeat across 3–5 sets) and the app has no RIR field to act on a wider band anyway. Keep, as a default inside "not to failure".

**4. The cue's "~3–5×/week".** Strength sessions per week, Galpin's element five. ACSM 2009's status ladder (3–4 → 4–5), NSCA's (3–4 → 4–7) and ACSM 2026's floor (≥ 2) all bracket it, but Grgic 2018 shows frequency adds strength only by adding volume. So the number is a whole-body *session count*, and it is the one element of the rule that is convention. Keep it in the cue (it is how the user plans a week); say so in the comment. Per-muscle strength dose stays on `weeklyMuscleTarget = 6` (011 D2), which this run does not reopen.

#### Caveats

- Population mismatch: the position stand pools healthy adults 18+ of every training age; Currier 2023 is 45 % women; the rest-interval review is 84 % men with a small trained subset; the failure meta-analyses are all young adults (Grgic 2022 says so outright); Robinson 2024 is exploratory with *estimated* RIR. **No located trial is in 40-year-old recreational lifters**, and the trained-lifter subgroup is where "> 2 min rest" and "non-failure" matter most, so the card leans on the smallest slices of these reviews.
- Strength here means **1RM on the trained lift** (Schoenfeld 2021): the heavy-load advantage largely vanishes on isometric or isokinetic tests. The app's per-muscle strength map inherits that specificity — a bench 1RM says little about a push-up.
- "% 1RM" is actionable only through the app's *estimated* 1RM (inventory §8), itself a formula with its own error; on the card it is a heaviness cue, not a prescription the user can set a bar to.
- The app has no RIR field, so "1–2 reps shy" cannot be checked against a logged set; it is guidance, and it shapes no read.
- What would move this number: a volume-equated trial of 80 vs 90 % 1RM in trained adults over 35 (would settle 85 vs 80 with data instead of arithmetic); a dedicated meta-analysis of RIR on 1RM in trained lifters (Robinson is exploratory); an RIR field in the log (would let "1–2 shy" become a read rather than a cue).

#### Source comment
```
// rx.strength — heavy loads drive 1RM strength: ≥80 % 1RM in the position stand (ACSM 2026, Currier) and

```

**Decision (S5, 2026-09-03):** no number moves and no text changes. All five
`rx` fields stay as shipped; the source comment carries the literature's
≥ 80 % line and the reason 85 stays (fork 1), the 1–6 RM band behind 3–5
(fork 2), the "not to failure" band behind 1–2 RIR (fork 3) and the
session-count nature of "~3–5×/week" (fork 4). **The cue keeps "Galpin's 3–5
rule" and is now attributed** — Huberman Lab guest series part 2 (2023) and
episode 65 (2022) in the source comment and inventory row 3.4 — which closes
row 3.4's half of acceptance box 3; on screen the reference card's existing
"Based on the Huberman Lab × Dr. Andy Galpin guest series" line is literally
true for this cue and stays until S10 closes. `weeklyMuscleTarget = 6` (011
D2) and `repRange [1, 5]` (S11) are not reopened.

### S6 — ADAPTATIONS[muscular_endurance].rx (what a muscular-endurance set is prescribed as)

**Claim:** A local muscular-endurance set is trained at **< 50 % 1RM**, **15–40+ reps**, **2–4 sets**, **< 60 s** rest, **to / near failure**, as "high-rep, short-rest circuits and bodyweight work" (`rx`, row 3.6). Drives the prescription text the user reads before an endurance session; the *classification* edge (`repRange [16, 999]`, row 2.3) is S11's and untouched here.
**Searched:** 2026-09-03 · **Verdict:** partially supported — high reps **supported** (≥ 15 reps beat 7–13 for relative endurance in the one meta-analysis on the question, and in every trained- and untrained-adult trial that tested at post-training 1RM); the load band is **partially supported** and the card's `< 50 %` does not describe the same set as its `15–40+` reps (a 15 RM is ≈ 65 % 1RM) — it moves to the position stand's **40–60 %**; sets and rest are **convention only** inside the stands' bands (one trained-lifter trial found rest length irrelevant to the endurance outcome); "to / near failure" is how every located trial trained, not a variable anyone tested.
**Number to use:** field by field —
- **load:** **40–60 % 1RM** (ACSM 2009's local-endurance prescription; NSCA < 67 %). The trials that produced the endurance advantage trained at 20–35 RM (≈ 50–65 %) and 30–40 RM (≈ 40–50 %). Default: `40–60% 1RM` — **changes** from `<50% 1RM`, see fork 2.
- **reps:** `15–40+` — ACSM 2009 says > 15; Hackett 2022's winning band is 18–125; the trials ran 20–28, 25–35 and 30–40 RM. Unchanged.
- **sets:** `2–4` — ACSM 2009 gives no set count for endurance; NSCA says 2–3; the trials used 1–3 sets; more sets gave more endurance in the one dose–response trial (5 > 3 > 1). Convention inside the band; unchanged.
- **rest:** `Short (<60 s)` — ACSM 2009 says < 90 s, NSCA < 30 s, de Salles 20–60 s; the one chronic trial with an endurance outcome in trained men found 1 min = 3 min. Convention; unchanged.
- **effort:** `To / near failure` — every located trial prescribed RM sets; Galpin says "practice frequently to the point of failure". No failure-vs-non-failure trial with an endurance outcome was located. Convention by design of the evidence; unchanged.
- **cue:** unchanged. "Bodyweight work" is the honest escape from "% 1RM" for a quality the user mostly trains without a bar.

#### Evidence

*(a) Load and reps — is there an endurance zone at all?*

- `[literature]` "For local muscular endurance training, it is recommended that **light to moderate loads (40–60 % of 1 RM)** be performed for **high repetitions (> 15)** using **short rest periods (< 90 s)**." Position stand — [ACSM 2009, Med Sci Sports Exerc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19204579/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S4). The 2026 update reports that resistance training improves endurance vs no exercise but gives no endurance-specific prescription — [ACSM 2026, Currier et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41843416/) (PMID verified via eutils)
- `[literature]` Higher reps per set improve relative local endurance more than lower reps **when tested at a percentage of post-training 1RM** (g = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.53–1.40; **18–125 reps vs 7–13 reps: g = 1.08**) but not at pre-training 1RM (g = 0.09); "strength gains moderated training outcomes". Systematic review + meta-analysis + meta-regression, 14 studies — [Hackett, Ghayomzadeh, Farrell, Davies & Sabag 2022, Science & Sports](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scispo.2021.11.002) (DOI verified via Crossref)
- `[literature]` "Evidence for a load-specific effect on local muscular endurance remains equivocal … If there is in fact a load-induced effect on muscular endurance, which remains questionable, it seemingly is limited to the far rightward aspect of the repetition continuum." The answer flips with the test: post-training-1RM tests favour light loads, pre-training-1RM tests show nothing (Jessee 2018, Buckner: 70 % vs 15 % 1RM, no difference at 42.5 % of *pre* 1RM).

- `[literature]` In women the picture is mixed by region: 3 × 6–8 RM vs 2 × 15–20 RM vs 1 × 30–40 RM, 9 weeks — upper-body absolute endurance favoured the *medium* load (44 vs 31 vs 20 %), lower-body favoured the light load (137 vs 84 vs 80 %); re-scored on post-training 1RM the upper-body difference vanished. 50 untrained young women — Stone & Coulter 1994 (not on PubMed; as summarised in [Schoenfeld 2021, PMC7927075](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7927075/))

Textbook (expert-consensus tier) — [NSCA Essentials ch. 17 table, as transcribed](https://www.ptpioneer.com/personal-training/certifications/nsca-cscs/cscs-chapter-17/) (cited in S4)

*(b) Sets*

- `[literature]` Dose–response by sets over 6 months: bench-press **20 RM** rose most with 5 sets, then 3, then 1 (each step significant); leg-press 20 RM 5 sets > 1 set. RCT, 48 untrained men (1 / 3 / 5 sets / control), 3×/wk — [Radaelli et al. 2015, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546444/) (PMID verified via eutils). More sets buy more endurance; the card's 2–4 is a mid-band convention.

*(c) Rest*

- `[literature]` "The research on rest interval length in relation to chronic muscular endurance adaptations is less clear": short rests (**20 s to 1 min**) kept rep velocity higher during repeated submaximal actions and raised total torque in a high-intensity cycle test — "indirect" support for short rests. Narrative review, 35 studies — [de Salles et al. 2009, Sports Med](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691365/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S4)
- `[literature]` 1 min vs 3 min rest for 8 weeks in trained men: strength and thickness favoured 3 min, but **local endurance (50 % 1RM bench to failure) rose equally in both groups**. RCT, 21 resistance-trained men — [Schoenfeld et al. 2016, J Strength Cond Res](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807/) (PMID verified via eutils, cited in S5). The only chronic rest trial with an endurance outcome in this population found rest length did not matter.

*(d) Effort*

- `[literature]` Every trial above that produced an endurance advantage trained with **RM sets** — reps to momentary failure at the set load (Campos 2002, Schoenfeld 2015, Anderson & Kearney 1982, Radaelli 2015). No trial comparing failure with non-failure *on an endurance outcome* was located; the failure meta-analyses (Grgic 2022, Davies 2016, Vieira 2021 — S5) report strength, hypertrophy and power only. "To / near failure" therefore rests on the design of the evidence, not on a comparison.

*(e) The practitioners*

- `[single-practitioner position]` Muscular endurance is load-specific practice: "you don't need heavy load — it only needs to be around what your target is (e.g. want to improve at 50 % 1RM, just train in that range)"; rep range "5–50 per the definition"; "the best way to train for muscular endurance is to practice frequently to the point of failure"; "you won't be as sore so you can easily do 3–4× per week per muscle group"; progress by "1–2 reps per week". Galpin only — [guest series pt 3 (notes)](https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-physical-endurance-lose-fat-huberman-lab/), [episode page](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-physical-endurance-and-lose-fat)
- `[single-practitioner position]` No separate endurance quality: 5–30 reps per set is all hypertrophy "as long as you're working close to failure"; local endurance is not programmed as its own goal. Israetel only; Galpin disagrees by giving it a card of its own; Attia silent — [RP article, mirrored](https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/26017357-exercise-scientist-explains-size-vs-strength-training)
- `[practitioner consensus]` Whatever the load, endurance sets are long, near failure and repeated often. Held by Galpin and (implicitly, as the top of his hypertrophy range) Israetel; the literature above does not contradict.

#### Where they split

Four forks; the first is the literature's own, the others are Tekiō's.

**1. Does load matter for endurance, or only the test?** The continuum (ACSM 2009, NSCA, Hackett 2022, Campos, Schoenfeld 2015) says light-load high-rep work builds endurance that heavy work does not; Schoenfeld 2021 and Wang 2023 say the effect appears only when endurance is scored against the *new* 1RM — heavy training raises the 1RM, so its "60 %" is a heavier weight, which is a harder test, not a worse adaptation. Both are true. What survives either reading is **specificity**: you get better at repeating the load you practise repeating (Galpin's framing, and the one the pre-1RM tests do not refute). The card should claim that, not "light loads build a separate quality". The decision: keep the card, keep it load-banded, and let the comment say what the band is *for* — practising the load you want to repeat.

**2. `< 50 %` or `40–60 %`.** The card's load ceiling and its rep floor describe two different sets: a 15-rep set to failure is ≈ 65 % 1RM, and nothing at < 50 % fails at 15. Every source with a number gives a *band* — ACSM 40–60 %, NSCA < 67 %, the trials 40–65 % — and the card's `< 50 %` came from nowhere the search could find (Galpin's example is "50 %", as an example of a target, not a ceiling). Move the load to **`40–60% 1RM`** so that load, reps and effort describe one set; bodyweight work sidesteps the percentage through the cue. This is the run's one value change, recorded as ledger D19 *before* the constant is edited (`/ground` hard rule).

**3. Rest: 30, 60 or 90 s.** Three conventions (NSCA, the card, ACSM), one trial (Schoenfeld 2016) in which the difference between 1 and 3 min did not reach the endurance outcome, and de Salles' indirect acute support for 20–60 s. Keep `< 60 s` and label it convention: it is the middle number, it matches the acute evidence, and it is what a circuit is.

**4. Is endurance a quality or the top of hypertrophy's range?** Israetel folds 20–30-rep sets into hypertrophy; Galpin and the app give them a card. [019](done/019-adaptation-model-simplification.md) already answered for the app (seven qualities, endurance among them), and §6.0's overlap is the honest reconciliation: once S11 lands, a 20-rep set can count toward hypertrophy *and* endurance, so the card does not have to choose. Nothing to decide here; recorded so S11 knows the fork exists.

#### Caveats

- Population mismatch: the endurance trials are untrained young men (Campos n = 32, Anderson n = 43, Radaelli n = 48), untrained young women (Stone n = 50) and one group of trained young men (Schoenfeld 2015, n = 18); the meta-analyses pool those (Hackett, 14 studies) or older adults (Wang, 15 studies). **No located trial is in 40-year-old recreational lifters**, and the trained-adult evidence is a single 18-man study.
- The outcome measure decides the answer: at post-training 1RM light loads win, at pre-training 1RM nothing does. The app measures neither — it counts sets — so the card's claim is a training cue, not a read, and the muscle map's endurance fill inherits nothing from this run.
- "% 1RM" is not actionable for bodyweight circuits, planks or tennis footwork — the modality this user trains endurance with; for those the reps and effort fields carry the prescription and the load field is decoration. The cue names them for that reason.
- The app has no RIR field: "to / near failure" cannot be checked against a logged set, and a 20-rep set stopped at 5 RIR reads the same as one to failure.
- What would move this number: a trained-adult trial with *both* absolute and relative endurance tests (would say whether the load effect is real or a scoring artefact); a failure-vs-non-failure trial with an endurance outcome (would ground the effort field); an RIR field (would make the effort field a read).

#### Source comment
```
// rx.muscular_endurance — 40–60 % 1RM for >15 reps with <90 s rest is the ACSM 2009 prescription; the card's
// <60 s and 2–4 sets are conventions inside it (NSCA: <67 %, >12 reps, 2–3 sets, <30 s). Higher reps (≥15;
// 18–125) beat 7–13 for relative endurance when tested at post-training 1RM (Hackett 2022, 14 studies;
// Campos 2002; Schoenfeld 2015; Anderson & Kearney 1982) but not at pre-training 1RM — the load effect is
// equivocal (Schoenfeld 2021, Wang 2023), so the honest claim is specificity: you get better at repeating the
// load you practise. More sets help (Radaelli 2015: 5 > 3 > 1 for 20 RM); rest length did not (Schoenfeld
// 2016: 1 min = 3 min). "To/near failure" is how every located trial trained, not a tested variable. Load
// moved <50 % → 40–60 % on 2026-09-03 (039 S6 fork 2, ledger D19) so the load and rep fields describe one
// set. See docs/roadmap/039-adaptations-read-grounding.md#grounding
```

**Decision (S6, 2026-09-03):** one number moves. `rx.load` goes from
`<50% 1RM` to **`40–60% 1RM`** (fork 2) — the position stand's band, and the
only value under which the card's load, reps and effort describe the same set;
recorded as ledger D19 before the constant was edited. Reps, sets, rest,
effort and cue stay as shipped, with sets and rest labelled **convention** in
the source comment (forks 3) and effort labelled as inherited from the trials'
design. Fork 1 is settled by wording, not by a number: the comment states the
claim as specificity ("you get better at repeating the load you practise")
rather than "light loads build a separate quality", which is what survives
both readings of the evidence. Fork 4 is [019](done/019-adaptation-model-simplification.md)'s
and §6.0's, noted for S11. `weeklyMuscleTarget = 6` (011, convention) and
`repRange [16, 999]` (S11) are not reopened. The reference card's attribution
line stays until S10.

## 5. Acceptance

- [x] §1's accounting decision is made, written here with its reason, and the
      losing dialect(s) deleted from the code. (2026-09-02, v1.13.0 — §6.1
      option (a); `muscleCoverage` and its card are gone.)
- [ ] A `## Grounding` section exists here carrying verdicts for rows 7.1, 7.5,
      `CYCLE_SET_TARGET`-as-total, and the seven `rx` blocks (3.3, 3.4, 3.6–3.10).
- [ ] Rows 3.4 and 3.8 either carry attribution for the named protocol they ship,
      or no longer ship it. (3.4 done 2026-09-03 — S5 keeps "Galpin's 3–5 rule",
      attributed, D18; 3.8 waits for S8.)
- [ ] Rep bands overlap (§6.0): `classifyWeightSet` returns every quality whose
      band covers the set; rows 2.1–2.3 and 2.6 carry verdicts here; the
      per-quality sums may exceed a muscle's total and the tab says so on screen.
- [x] The muscle read's window is its own grounded constant (§6.6, S12), not
      the program's `CYCLE`; `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` and `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` are
      gone and Home names the window and the weekly rate on screen.
      (2026-09-03, v1.16.0 — `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` / `MUSCLE_SET_TARGET` in
      app.ts, `HISTORY_WEEKS = 6` keeps the sheet's bars as history.)
- [ ] Every covered inventory row names this brief as its carrier and shows a
      current verdict; `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR` and `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` have rows.
- [ ] Citations verified through NCBI eutils before being pasted, not from a
      search-result summary.
- [ ] The app still builds and every existing adaptation test passes; any number
      that moved is reflected in its test.

## 6. Kickoff findings — 2026-09-02 (where it left off)

The first session read every file in §1–§2 and stopped before touching code
(context wrap-up). Everything below is settled enough to execute without
re-reading; the one open check is marked.

### 6.0 Amendment 2026-09-02 — rep bands overlap, and the sums may exceed the total

Peter, picking the brief up again the same day: *if the rep-range stimulus per
adaptation is not grounded, ground it here; and we know a rep range can trigger
more than one stimulus, so on the Adaptations screen the combined sets across
adaptations can pass beyond the muscle's total sets.*

That is a decision, and it changes three things in the plan below.

**1. The classifier becomes multi-valued.** Today `classifyWeightSet` is a
strict partition — `[1,5]` strength, `[6,15]` hypertrophy, `[16,999]` muscular
endurance — so a set of 5 is 100 % strength and a set of 16 is 0 % hypertrophy.
The bands are made to **overlap** and the function returns every quality whose
band covers the set; a set inside an overlap counts **in full** toward each.
This is the model cardio already uses (`classifyCardioAdaptations` awards a
hard ride to both VO₂max and anaerobic capacity). It is *not* the fractional
scheme 001 sketched (0.7 strength + 0.3 hypertrophy): no weighting curve, no
partial sets — a set is a set. Overrides still win outright: an exercise tagged
power is one power set and nothing else.

Why it matters here and not just in theory — the logged sets by rep band
(Supabase, 2026-09-02, all history, 838 sets):

| reps | 1–5 | 6–8 | 9–12 | 13–15 | 16–20 | 21–30 | 31+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sets | 48 | 142 | 289 | 103 | 170 | 74 | 12 |

A fifth of everything ever logged sits at 16–20 reps and today buys **zero**
hypertrophy credit, against a literature that finds hypertrophy per hard set
roughly load-independent from ~30 % 1RM up. The disjoint cut is the least
honest number on the page.

**2. The invariant flips.** §6.1 planned to assert `total = Σ byQuality`. Under
overlap the honest statement is `max_q byQuality[q] ≤ total ≤ Σ_q byQuality[q]`:
Home's per-muscle total still counts each set **once** (the muscle did one set
of work), the per-adaptation maps count it once **per quality it trains**, and
the tab's per-adaptation sums may therefore exceed the muscle's total. (S3
narrowed this on 2026-09-02: power sets sit outside `total`, so the bracket
holds over the three hard qualities.) That is by design and it goes on screen — the tab already labels its window ("This
Week"); it now also says *a set can count toward more than one quality*, once,
where the four muscle-linked adaptations sit. The hero's "lifting sets" line
must not sum the four `volume`s any more (it would double count); it reports
the set count once.

**3. Rows 2.1–2.3 and 2.6 come into this brief**, and 001 retires. The band
edges are the numbers being grounded; the keyword rules (2.6 — "jumps, throws,
Olympic lifts, swings, sprints are power regardless of reps") are the same
claim as power's `rx` cue, so S4 carries them. 001 is set `blocked — decided,
ships inside 039` now and moves to `done/` when this brief does.

**Where the band edges come from:** the S11 scout run below, not this session.
The current `repRange` values are the *disjoint* cut and will move; per the
`/ground` hard rule the new edges are recorded as a decision in `## Grounding`
before the constant is edited. The shape the code needs is unchanged —
`repRange: [lo, hi]` per adaptation, now allowed to overlap — and
`classifyWeightSet` walks all of `REP_DERIVED` instead of stopping at the first
hit. Expected literature: the repetition-continuum re-examination
(Schoenfeld, Grgic, Van Every, Plotkin 2021), the low- vs high-load
meta-analyses (Schoenfeld 2017; Lopez 2021), and Campos 2002 for the classic
three-zone specificity result — all to be verified through eutils.

### 6.1 The accounting decision — (a), made concrete

**(a) is taken.** One accounting: *stimulus = level-weighted sets in a window;
adequacy = a weekly rate × the weeks in that window.* The window is the only
thing that stays plural, and it is named on screen.

| Today | Under (a) |
|---|---|
| `muscleStates` ([fusedRead.ts:57](../../src/lib/fusedRead.ts#L57)) — its own loop, 42 d, all sets, ÷ `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` | Built on the shared function; window = rolling `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` (→ `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS`, §6.6); `sets` = the sum of the four muscle-linked qualities (→ the three hard ones, S3) |
| `adaptationCoverage` ([lib/adaptations.ts:159](../../src/lib/adaptations.ts#L159)) — its own loop, week-to-date, per adaptation, + a habit fold | Built on the shared function; window = calendar week-to-date; per adaptation; **habit fold dropped** (doctrine §5 already ruled: the muscle read counts logged sets only — the `habits` / `habitCompletions` / `exerciseNames` args go, and so do the two habit tests in `adaptations.test.ts`) |
| `muscleCoverage` ([utils.ts:558](../../src/lib/utils.ts#L558)) — week-to-date, no target, + recovery minutes, + habits | **Deleted**, with `MuscleCoverageRow`, `MuscleCoverageCard.tsx` (its only consumer), its `<MuscleCoverageCard />` line in `AdaptationsTab.tsx`, and the `muscleCoverage` block in `habits.test.ts`. `habitMuscleContributions` and `recoveryHabitSets` in utils.ts are then used only by tests — delete them too (035 was going to) |

**The shared function** — new, in `src/lib/adaptations.ts` (fusedRead already
imports from there):

```ts
/** Level-weighted sets per muscle group inside [from, to]. `total` counts
 *  each set once — a set is one set of stimulus for the muscle however many
 *  qualities it trains. `byQuality[q]` counts the set in full for every
 *  quality whose rep band covers it (§6.0), so Σ byQuality ≥ total. */
export function muscleStimulus(
  weights, exerciseMuscles, window: { from: string; to: string }, overrides?,
): { total: Record<string, number>; byQuality: Record<MuscleQuality, Record<string, number>> }
```

Classification per set is `classifyWeightSet(reps, resolveExerciseAdaptation(...))`,
which under §6.0 returns an **array** — the same override-aware rule
`muscleQualityMix` already uses, so `muscleQualityMix` becomes a thin caller as
well. Add one test asserting the two invariants:
`max_q byQuality[q][m] ≤ total[m] ≤ Σ_q byQuality[q][m]` for every muscle, and
a set of 5 reps counting once in `total` and once each in strength *and*
hypertrophy.

**Open check — closed 2026-09-02.** The override column is
`exercises.default_adaptation`; exactly one row carries a value (Dead Hang →
muscular_endurance). No override names a cardio quality, so every logged set
classifies muscle-linked and `total` is exact. Keep the guard in the function
comment: an override naming a cardio quality would still count in `total`
(the muscle did the work) and in no `byQuality` bucket.

**The denominator.** `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` stops being a literal: it becomes
`WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × CYCLE` where `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR = 10` carries the
adaptation-agnostic claim the scout below rules on. `MuscleSheet.tsx:17`
already derives `WEEKLY_TARGET = CYCLE_SET_TARGET / CYCLE` — invert that.
(Done 2026-09-02; superseded on 2026-09-03 — the `× CYCLE` goes too, §6.6.)
The DB shadow (inventory 1.11) means the tab reads `adaptation_targets` while
Home reads the constant; they are byte-identical today. Note it, do not fix it.

**The ramp.** Home colours by continuous `fillFraction`
([GapMap.tsx:16-21](../../src/components/tabs/home/GapMap.tsx#L16), cutoff 0.70);
the tab colours by the three-step `status` ([lib/adaptations.ts:146](../../src/lib/adaptations.ts#L146)).
Add `fillFraction` to `MuscleStatusRow` so 031 can draw one ramp; whether
`status` survives is the row-7.5 scout's call.

**On-screen window labels** already exist on Home (`"N sets in 42 days"`,
`"42-day cycle · target 60"`) and on the tab (`"This Week"`). The
`<strong>PLACEHOLDER</strong>` after `target {CYCLE_SET_TARGET}` in
[MuscleSheet.tsx:161](../../src/components/tabs/home/MuscleSheet.tsx#L161) is the
mark 018 left for exactly this brief's verdict — replace it when the block lands.

### 6.2 Row 7.4 is retired, not grounded

`WEEKLY_STRETCH_TARGET_MIN = 5` sat at `utils.ts:338` when the inventory was
built (commit `ecfc547`). It no longer exists anywhere in `src/` — it went with
`RecoveryCard` (014 step 3). Strike row 7.4 as **retired**; drop it from this
brief's scope. 031 §3c cuts the recovery axis from the page anyway.

### 6.3 The scout runs — twelve, one decision each, two at a time

All `subagent_type: science-scout`, each given the claim, the constant, the
current value, this brief's path, and the date. Verify every citation through
NCBI eutils before pasting (acceptance box 5).

| # | Row | Claim to hand the scout | Constant · value |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 7.1 | A set on an exercise where the muscle is a level-2 (secondary) mover counts as half a set of stimulus for that muscle, level-3 a quarter — the fractional-set convention every map is denominated in | `LEVEL_WEIGHT` [utils.ts:490](../../src/lib/utils.ts#L490) · `{1: 1, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.25}`. Pelland 2026's best-fit model counts indirect sets at 0.5 (already cited in [010 §Grounding](done/010-home-fused-reads.md#grounding)) — the scout's job is the 0.25 tier and whether 0.5 is "indirect" in the same sense |
| S2 | 7.5 | Stimulus below the weekly floor is graded (each set buys some adaptation), so a continuous fill is honest and a three-step on-track / needs-work / untouched cut is a coarsening; is anything below the floor worth *zero*? | `statusFor` [lib/adaptations.ts:146](../../src/lib/adaptations.ts#L146) + `GAP_CUTOFF = 0.70` [GapMap.tsx:16](../../src/components/tabs/home/GapMap.tsx#L16) |
| S3 | new row | 10 level-weighted sets/muscle/week **counted across every rep range** (strength, hypertrophy, endurance and power sets all pooled) is a defensible adequacy floor for *total* muscle stimulus — i.e. the hypertrophy floor is the right adaptation-agnostic denominator because it is the most volume-hungry of the four | `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR` (new) · `10`, and `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` [app.ts:90](../../src/constants/app.ts#L90) · `60`. The *value* is grounded (010 D10); the *pooling* is the claim |
| S4 | 3.3, 2.6 | Power prescription: 30–70% 1RM, 1–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 2–5 min rest, never to fatigue; and the keyword rule that jumps, throws, Olympic lifts, swings, sleds and sprints are power work regardless of rep count (row 2.6) | `ADAPTATIONS[power].rx` [adaptations.ts:78](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L78) |
| S5 | 3.4 | Strength prescription: 85–100% 1RM, 3–5 reps, 3–5 sets, 2–5 min rest, 1–2 RIR; and the cue "Galpin's 3–5 rule" (3–5 reps × sets × min rest × sessions/wk) — attribute or remove | `ADAPTATIONS[strength].rx` [adaptations.ts:109](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L109) |
| S6 | 3.6 | Muscular-endurance prescription: <50% 1RM, 15–40+ reps, 2–4 sets, <60 s rest, to/near failure | `ADAPTATIONS[muscular_endurance].rx` [adaptations.ts:163](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L163) |
| S7 | 3.7 | Anaerobic-capacity prescription: all-out 20 s–2 min efforts, 3–8 rounds, 1:2–1:4 work:rest | `ADAPTATIONS[anaerobic_capacity].rx` [adaptations.ts:189](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L189) |
| S8 | 3.8 | VO₂max prescription: 90–100% HRmax, 3–8 min efforts, 4–6 sets, ≈1:1 rest; and the cue "classic 4×4 min at 90–95% HRmax, 3 min easy" — expected source Helgerud 2007 (verify) — attribute or remove | `ADAPTATIONS[vo2max].rx` [adaptations.ts:220](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L220) |
| S9 | 3.9 | Endurance prescription: Zone 2 / conversational, 30 min–hours continuous; the cue's mechanistic claims "nasal-breathing pace" and "builds mitochondria & fat oxidation" | `ADAPTATIONS[endurance].rx` [adaptations.ts:251](../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L251) |

| S12 | new row | A muscle's stimulus is judged over a **rolling 14-day window** against twice the weekly floor (20 hard sets), shown as "10/wk" (§6.6): long enough that a muscle trained once a week does not read as untouched on the morning of its session, short enough that a muscle silent for the whole window has genuinely missed its dose. Return the honest band for the window length and the default — expected literature: per-muscle training-frequency meta-analyses (Schoenfeld 2016, 2019), detraining time-courses (Bosquet 2013, Ogasawara 2013), how long one session's muscle-protein-synthesis response lasts | `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` (new, in app.ts beside `QUALITY_STALENESS_DAYS`) · `14`, replacing `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS = CYCLE × 7` [fusedRead.ts:25](../../src/lib/fusedRead.ts#L25) · `42`; target `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS / 7` · `20`, replacing `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` · `60` |

Hypertrophy's `rx` (row 3.5) is **out**: grounded in 011 and locked to the
target (D3). Do not re-run it.

**Attribution already on the page:** `AdaptationGuide.tsx` ends with *"Based
on the Huberman Lab × Dr. Andy Galpin guest series on physical adaptations."*
That is a practitioner attribution for all seven blocks at once, in a collapsed
card. After S4–S10 land, that line either becomes the honest provenance
(literature where found, `convention` where not) or goes; the per-card InfoTip
carries no attribution at all today.

### 6.4 Landing the blocks — the four `/ground` destinations

1. **This brief:** paste all twelve blocks verbatim under a `## Grounding` section
   placed before `## Acceptance` (i.e. between §4 and §5), one `###` per run.
2. **The constants:** source comments on `LEVEL_WEIGHT`, `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR`,
   `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS`, each `rx` block and `ADAPTATION_PRINCIPLE`, every one
   pointing at `docs/roadmap/039-adaptations-read-grounding.md#grounding`
   (repoint to `done/` when the brief moves — `grep -rn 039- src/`).
3. **The inventory** ([grounding-inventory.md](../grounding-inventory.md)):
   rows 2.1–2.3, 2.6, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6–3.10, 7.1, 7.5 → carrier `039`, verdict updated, and the
   `Where` line numbers refreshed (7.1 says `utils.ts:479`, now 490; 7.5 says
   `lib/adaptations.ts:135-139`, now 146-150 — both move again after §6.1).
   Row 7.4 struck as retired (§6.2). New row **7.7** for `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR`
   as the pooled total (S3) and **7.8** for `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` (S12). New
   ledger rows D13+ for each *decision* (the pooling, the 0.25 tier, the ramp,
   the window leaving the cycle, each attribution kept or removed).
   Bump the counts paragraph and add an "Updated 2026-09-xx by the 039 runs"
   note in *How to read it*.
4. **shamatoff-os inbox:** only if a run produces durable life-knowledge
   (unlikely here — these are training prescriptions).

### 6.5 Running order and checkpoints

Each unit build-passes on its own; commit and push after each.

1. **Code — the accounting** (§6.0 + §6.1): `classifyWeightSet` returns an
   array (callers: `adaptationCoverage`, `muscleQualityMix`, `powerSetCount`,
   the tests); shared function, both callers on it; `muscleCoverage` + card +
   dead habit helpers deleted; the hero's "lifting sets" counts sets once; the
   one-line "a set can count toward more than one quality" label on the tab;
   tests updated, the invariant test added. The band *edges* stay at today's
   values in this unit — overlap is only exercised by the test until S11 lands.
   Browser-verify Home and the Adaptations tab (the tab loses its MUSCLE
   COVERAGE card — expected; 031 rebuilds the page).
   **Minor bump** (1.13.0, tagged) — the tab visibly changes.
2. **Scouts** (§6.3) — **two at a time, never all at once.** The first
   attempt (2026-09-02) dispatched all eleven in parallel; ten died on the
   5-hour session limit and only S2 came back. One scout costs roughly an hour
   of interactive work, so a batch of eleven is most of a window. Run them in
   pairs (S1+S3 done; then S12+S4, S5+S6, S7+S8, S9+S10, S11 alone — reordered
   2026-09-03 so the window lands before the `rx` blocks), eutils-check each
   block as it lands, paste it under `## Grounding`, and commit after each pair so a dead
   session loses at most two runs. Then land per §6.4, including any `rx`
   text the verdicts change (record a changed value as a decision *before*
   editing the constant — `/ground` hard rule). Patch bump per pair.
   **Done so far:** S2 (v1.13.1) — block in `## Grounding`, source comments on
   `statusFor` and `GAP_CUTOFF`. S1 + S3 (v1.13.2) — blocks; `LEVEL_WEIGHT`
   comment carried the convention label until
   [done/042](done/042-level-3-link-audit.md) zeroed the tier (v1.14.0,
   2026-09-03); `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR` created and
   `CYCLE_SET_TARGET` derived from it, power sets out of `total`, sheet
   PLACEHOLDERs replaced. S12 + S4 (blocks v1.14.1; units v1.16.0 and
   v1.16.1) — inventory rows 2.6, 3.3, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8 and ledger D14–D17
   landed with them. S5 + S6 (v1.16.3, run inline — §6.9) — blocks; source
   comments on both `rx` blocks; endurance load `<50%` → `40–60% 1RM` (D19);
   rows 3.4 and 3.6, ledger D18–D20 — so the final pass owes only the S7–S11
   rows.
3. **Close:** tick §5, move this file to `done/`, repoint the source comments,
   move [001](001-cross-adaptation-rep-ranges.md) to `done/` as
   `done — decided and shipped inside 039`, repoint its links (031 §4, 034,
   the inventory), and set [031](031-adaptations-drill-down-read.md) to
   `planned` (019, 026, 039 all landed). Patch bump.

### 6.6 Amendment 2026-09-03 — the muscle window leaves the program cycle

Peter, after S1 + S3 landed: *the six-week cycle is the program's — the one
saved program in the database. Home and the Adaptations reads were never meant
to be grounded on it. Everything there should be science- or convention-based,
and muscle adaptation is researched per week. Cardio already has its own
timings; do the same for muscles, so it is (1) easy to follow — we live in
weeks — and (2) grounded. I don't push on the 60-set cycle.*

**What the read hangs on today.** `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS = CYCLE × 7`
([fusedRead.ts:25](../../src/lib/fusedRead.ts#L25), 42 days) and
`CYCLE_SET_TARGET = WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × CYCLE`
([app.ts:99](../../src/constants/app.ts#L99), 60). `CYCLE` is the program's
cycle length — the constant `cycleInfo` and the deload logic run on. Neither
the 42 nor the 60 was ever grounded: S3 ruled on the *rate* (10 hard sets per
muscle per week) and on the pooling; the 60 is that rate times a program length
nobody asked the research about, and §6.1's "the window is the only thing that
stays plural" left it unexamined. Cardio's equivalents —
`QUALITY_STALENESS_DAYS` (14 / 14 / 28) and each quality's
`weeklySessionTarget` — are grounded per quality in 011 and owe nothing to the
program. Four consumers read the cycle window: `muscleStates` (the fill),
`powerSetCount`, `muscleWeeks` (the sheet's six weekly bars) and
`muscleSources`; Home's copy says "this cycle" twice.

**Decision (Peter, 2026-09-03).** The per-muscle read gets its own window
constant, `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS`, in app.ts beside `QUALITY_STALENESS_DAYS`. Its
target is `WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR × MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS / 7`. `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` and
`CYCLE_SET_TARGET` go. `CYCLE` stays exactly what it is — the program's cycle
— and nothing on Home or the Adaptations tab reads it any more. The weekly
rate stays the unit on screen ("10/wk"), with the window named beside it
("N hard sets in 14 days").

**Value: rolling 14 days, target 20 — pending S12.** Chosen from three:

- **Rolling 14 days ÷ 20 (taken).** The shortest window in which a muscle
  trained once a week does not flip to empty on the morning of its session;
  one rhythm with the 14-day cardio staleness; and the detraining literature
  puts measurable loss past roughly two to three weeks, so a muscle silent for
  the whole window has honestly missed its dose.
- Rolling 7 days ÷ 10. The literature's own unit, but on leg-day morning the
  quads read as untouched as a muscle ignored for a month, and rank top of
  "what's missing".
- Calendar week-to-date, Monday start. What the Adaptations tab does today;
  on Monday morning every muscle is a gap — the wrong "what's missing" read.
- 42 days was not on the list: no muscle evidence speaks for it. Its one merit
  was averaging over the deload week, which is a program concern.

The window length is a number claiming physiological meaning (doctrine §4
q5), so it runs as **S12** before the constant changes. 14 is the value handed
to the scout; a verdict with a different default is a decision recorded here
first (`/ground` hard rule).

**What survives untouched:** S3's rate and pooling; S2's continuous fill and
`GAP_CUTOFF` (fractions of the window's target, whatever the window — 0.70
keeps meaning "70 % of the target"); S1's weights; `RECOVER_DAYS` and
`daysSince` (all-history recency).

**Code, when S12 lands** — one unit, minor bump (Home's map visibly changes):

1. app.ts: `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS = 14` with its source comment pointing here;
   `MUSCLE_SET_TARGET = WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR * MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS / 7`; delete
   `CYCLE_SET_TARGET`.
2. fusedRead.ts: `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` → `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` in `cycleWindow`
   (rename it `muscleWindow`), `muscleStates`, `powerSetCount` and
   `muscleSources`; `fillFraction` over `MUSCLE_SET_TARGET`; the
   `MuscleState.sets` doc. `muscleWeeks` keeps six weekly bars as *history* —
   history is not a claim — but driven by a plain display constant in the
   sheet, not by `CYCLE`.
3. MuscleSheet.tsx and HomeTab.tsx: "N hard sets in 14 days", "14-day window ·
   10/wk · power sets count on their own map"; "this cycle" → "in the last 14
   days"; the bars' caption says "last 6 weeks".
4. fusedRead.test.ts: eight references assume 42 / 60 — move them.
5. Inventory row 7.8 and a ledger row for this decision (§6.4 step 3).
6. Browser-verify Home: expect more muscles to read as gaps — a 14-day window
   is stricter on anything trained once a fortnight, which is the honest read.

### 6.7 Handoff 2026-09-03 — S12 + S4 blocks landed, code units next

Both blocks sit under `## Grounding`, every citation checked through eutils
or Crossref (v1.14.1). Neither verdict moved a value, so the code is a
label-and-rename job in two units, in this order.

**Unit S12 — the window — shipped 2026-09-03 (v1.16.0).** §6.6's six steps
as written below; inventory rows 7.7 and 7.8 and ledger D14 landed with it,
so the S4 inventory pass owes only rows 2.6, 3.3, 7.5 and D15–D17. The
plan, kept for the record: exactly §6.6's six steps, with the S12 source
comment on `MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS`.
Consumer map (2026-09-03): `CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` is read by `cycleWindow`,
`muscleStates` (fill ÷ `CYCLE_SET_TARGET`, [fusedRead.ts:112](../../src/lib/fusedRead.ts#L112)),
`powerSetCount` (:192), `muscleWeeklySets` (:229–236 — keep six bars through a
local `HISTORY_WEEKS = 6`: history, not a claim) and `muscleSources` (:271);
[HomeTab.tsx](../../src/components/tabs/home/HomeTab.tsx) :6/:83 and
[MuscleSheet.tsx](../../src/components/tabs/home/MuscleSheet.tsx)
:6/:8/:99/:103/:153/:159 read the two constants; `fusedRead.test.ts` imports
`CYCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` at :4 and uses it at :66, :69, :134, :152–153, :184, :208
(rename; the `muscleWeeklySets` expectation `[3,0,0,0,2,5]` assumes a 6-week
history — keep it via the display constant). Copy: MuscleSheet "this cycle"
(:84, :159, :180, :206, :224) → "in the last 14 days", bars captioned
"last 6 weeks"; HomeTab :79/:82 likewise. Inventory: new row 7.8
(`MUSCLE_WINDOW_DAYS` 14 — convention inside a grounded 8–21 d band) and
ledger D14 (the window leaves the program cycle; the fill is frequency-blind
by design, recency stays in `daysSince`).

**Unit S4 — power `rx` + keyword matcher — shipped 2026-09-03 (v1.16.1).**
As shipped: `hop` / `jump` match whole words (plural-tolerant RegExp entries
in `KEYWORD_ADAPTATION`), plus a one-entry `NOT_POWER` exclusion for "jump
rope", which a word boundary cannot catch; `clapping` added; tests for both
directions. The plan, kept for the record: (1)
`ADAPTATIONS[power].rx` gets the three text values in the S4 decision and the
S4 source comment above the block. (2) `KEYWORD_ADAPTATION` gets its comment
and the collision fix: the DB check (2026-09-03, `exercises` matching
`hop|jump|agility|sled|swing`) found Box Jump, Jump Back Squat, Pogo Hops and
Skater Hop correctly power, Leg Swings and Tennis Warm-Up Swings correctly
untouched (only `kettlebell swing` / `kb swing` match), and **Cable Woodchop
wrongly power via `hop`**. Match `hop` and `jump` on a word boundary rather
than adding exclusions; add a test that "Cable Woodchop" and "Jump Rope" are
not power while "Skater Hop" and "Jump Back Squat" are. (3)
`AdaptationGuide.tsx:32`'s attribution line stays until S10. (4) Inventory
rows 2.6 and 3.3 → carrier 039, `grounded` (with `sled` / `agility` marked
convention); ledger D15 (one load band kept, split in words), D16 (keyword
rule stays exclusive; RIR field is the upgrade path), D17 (strength sets never
feed the power map; the sheet's "heavy strength also builds power in the
not-yet-strong" line goes to [031](031-adaptations-drill-down-read.md)'s
scope — add it there in the same pass). (5) [043](done/043-scout-named-exercises-catalogue.md)
added **Clapping Push-up** (Galpin's list) and none of the 20 keywords match
it, so its sets classify by reps — decide whether `clapping` joins the list
in the same edit. Rows 7.5 (S2) and the new 7.7
(`WEEKLY_SET_FLOOR`, S3) land in the same inventory pass.

Then S5–S8, dispatched 2026-09-03 as one batch of four (Peter's call for that
session — the weekly limit was about to reset), then S9–S11.

### 6.8 Handoff 2026-09-03 (evening) — S5–S8 dispatched, lost to API overload

Unit S4 shipped (v1.16.1) and S5–S8 were dispatched in parallel in the same
session. All four scouts died on server-side `529 Overloaded` errors — each
was resumed twice with `SendMessage` and died again within minutes, before
finishing its opening reads — so **no block landed and nothing in this brief
is owed to them**. The session then hit the context wrap-up limit.

**Next session:** re-run S5–S8 from the §6.3 table. Each prompt hands the
scout the claim, the constant with its line numbers, the current value, this
brief's path and the date, names what is out of scope (011 targets, S11's
band edges, 005's classifier), lists the expected literature to verify, and
asks for S4's structure — number-to-use field by field, evidence grouped by
field, the forks Tekiō must choose on, caveats with the population mismatch,
and a multi-line source comment. Two at a time unless Peter says otherwise.
When a block lands: run the eutils/Crossref check (a 30-line
`cite-check.mjs` — PMIDs via `esummary`, DOIs via
`api.crossref.org/works/<DOI>`), decode HTML entities, paste it under
`## Grounding` as `### S<n> — …` with heading levels shifted one down, write
the **Decision** paragraph, then the code unit: source comment on the `rx`
block, any text the verdict changes (recorded as a decision *before* editing
the constant), inventory row + ledger rows, tests, build, browser check,
patch bump. S5 and S8 each carry a named protocol ("Galpin's 3–5 rule",
"4×4") whose attribution or removal is acceptance box 3.

**A cheaper way to receive a block:** a subagent's transcript is a JSONL
file the task notification names, and the block is its last assistant text.
A 40-line extractor (last assistant message containing `**Claim:**`,
HTML-unescaped, code fence stripped) writes it straight to a file, so the
block never has to be retyped into the brief by hand. Worth recreating in the
session scratchpad before dispatching.

### 6.9 Handoff 2026-09-03 (night) — S5 + S6 landed inline, S7 + S8 next

Peter asked for no subagents this run, so S5 and S6 were done **in the main
session**: PMIDs verified with a 30-line `cite-check.mjs` (esummary /
efetch abstracts / Crossref for DOIs), practitioner statements pulled with
WebFetch from the podcast-notes pages and Huberman Lab's own summaries, and
the blocks written straight into `## Grounding` (v1.16.3). Cost: the pair
filled one session to the context limit — the same budget a scout pair
costs, with none of the 529 deaths. **Not browser-verified:** the only visible
change is the endurance card's load string (`40–60% 1RM`) in the collapsed
"How to train each adaptation" reference; the session hit the wrap-up limit
before a screenshot — check it when S7 + S8 land.

**Next session — S7 + S8 (anaerobic capacity, VO₂max), inline, the same
way:** for each, esummary-verify the expected literature first (S8: Helgerud
2007 for the 4×4 attribution; S7: SIT / repeated-sprint meta-analyses),
efetch the abstracts, fetch Galpin's and Attia's positions (guest series pt 3
and The Drive #261 — URLs in S4/S6), write the block in S5/S6's shape
(number-to-use field by field, evidence grouped by field, forks, caveats,
source comment, Decision), then the code unit: source comment on the `rx`
block, any text a verdict changes (decision in the ledger *before* the
constant), inventory rows 3.7 / 3.8 + ledger rows, test, build, browser check,
patch bump. S8's "classic 4×4" is acceptance box 3's other half. Then
S9 + S10, S11 (§6.5 step 2), then §6.5 step 3 closes the brief.
