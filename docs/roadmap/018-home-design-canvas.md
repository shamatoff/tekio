# Roadmap: Home design canvas — a JIT design system for the fused read

**Status:** round 1 (structure) published 2026-08-27. Next: the five-second test
and the §6 pick (steps 2–3).
**Canvas URL:** https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a1534123-0c92-49dc-8fa1-3879279d16ee
Rounds 2
and 3 **update that same canvas** — they never invoke `/design` for a fresh one,
or the user's own edits in the editor are lost.
**Working files:** `design/home-canvas/` — committed to the repo, not the
scratchpad. The canvas is re-seeded from these files on every change, so they
have to outlive the session that made them. They sit outside `src/`, so they add
nothing to the bundle.
**Origin:** [010-home-fused-reads.md](010-home-fused-reads.md) §6 says its two open
questions are "easier to answer with the fused state concrete than in the
abstract." That is a request for a mockup. This brief is that mockup, plus the
design system it needs.
**Blocks:** the three remaining folds in
[014-doctrine-ledger-execution.md](014-doctrine-ledger-execution.md) and, through them,
R1's cap of four menu sections.

---

## The plain summary

Tekiō has a doctrine, a purpose sentence and an exit condition. It does not have
a design system. Today's look is whatever Tailwind's defaults plus emoji
produced, and the app has never been designed *against* the doctrine — only
built against it.

Two things make this the right moment:

1. **The exit condition is visual and timed.** "I open Home and, without tapping
   anything, know within five seconds…" cannot be judged from prose. It has to be
   looked at.
2. **Three folds are waiting on the same surface.** Water, Donations and Body
   Weight all fold onto Home/Recovery. Designing them together gives one coherent
   surface instead of three patches.

## The §4 checklist (doctrine R4)

1. **Which read does this sharpen?** Home — the product. No new surface, so R1 is
   not engaged; in fact this is what *unblocks* R1 being satisfied.
2. **What does it let me stop doing?** It lets the three blocked folds proceed,
   which removes three menu destinations. It also replaces ad-hoc per-card
   styling decisions with one system.
3. **Input or destination?** Neither — it is a *decision instrument*. It produces
   a picked design and two answered questions, not a shipped surface.
4. **What's the honest shape of the data?** The whole point. P2 says muscles are
   spatial and whole-body qualities are not; the canvas has to show both honestly
   in one screen without one lying about the other.
5. **Does it write a number claiming physiological meaning?** **Not yet, and it
   must not.** The local recovery windows are ungrounded. Every threshold on the
   canvas is a labelled placeholder. `/ground` runs before any of it becomes code
   — see step 7.

## Decisions taken 2026-08-27

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Scope | **Home + the three fold destinations.** Six artboards. Not the capture screens — doctrine §1 says capture is overhead. |
| Purpose | **Variants first, then refine.** Round 1 puts the §6 forks side by side and the user picks; later rounds refine the winner into a build spec. |
| Visual language | **Free.** Explicitly *not* constrained to today's cards / indigo / emoji. The user's words: "I don't want to stick to existing concepts just because we want to spare some work." |
| Grounding order | **Design first, ground after.** Labelled placeholder thresholds on the canvas; `/ground` before code. No scout run is dispatched by this brief. |
| Interaction | **Clickable prototype**, not static mockups. A tap on a muscle really opens the drill-in; the quick-add reveal really reveals. **The five-second test is run on first paint, before anything is tapped** — that is how the two rules stay compatible. |
| Rounds | **Three, and each is cheap.** Structure → look → refine. Never settle structure and visual language in the same pick: "I like B's layout but A's colours" is not an answer. |
| Icons | **Inline SVG, no emoji.** Icons have to recolour with muscle and readiness state, which emoji cannot do. This **supersedes** the standing "give Home cards an emoji icon" preference, for this surface. |

## The new constraint: the design system must encode P1

This is the part that makes it a *system* rather than a mockup. The user's
requirement:

> The design system should take into account our goal of JIT component delivery.

P1 has two faces and they are the same rule:

- **UX face** — the control appears where and when it is needed, inline on the
  surface that raised the question.
- **Performance face** — what isn't needed now isn't loaded now.

**Today the performance face is at zero.** Measured 2026-08-27, re-verified
2026-08-27:

- No `React.lazy`, no `Suspense`, no dynamic `import()` anywhere in `src/`. (The
  single grep hit, `src/constants/program.ts:31`, is a type-only `import('../types')`.)
- One chunk: **1,142 kB / 322 kB gzip**. Vite's own 500 kB warning fires on every
  build and has simply been lived with.
- `bootstrap()` loads every domain in parallel at startup, whether or not the
  first screen needs it.

So the design system cannot be a colour palette and a type scale. It has to
define **when each component exists**, in three tiers, and those tiers must be
the same list for the designer and for the bundler:

| Tier | Rule | Loads |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 — At rest** | On screen the moment Home paints. This is the entire five-second answer and nothing else. | In the initial chunk |
| **T2 — On intent** | Appears when the read raises a question: a drill-in, a detail panel, an inline capture control. | Lazy chunk, prefetched on hover/focus |
| **T3 — On demand** | Everything reached by an explicit destination change. | Lazy chunk, no prefetch |

A component's tier is a design decision *and* a code-splitting boundary. If the
canvas puts something in T1 that costs 300 kB, the design is wrong — not the
build. That is the honest reading of "both faces are the same rule."

**The tension to resolve, not dodge:** the exit condition says *without tapping
anything*, while P1 says *what isn't needed now isn't loaded now*. These only
look opposed. The resolution the canvas must express: **the answer is always
visible (T1); the detail and the capture are just in time (T2).** A design that
hides the answer behind a tap fails §6. A design that puts every chart in T1
fails P1.

Because the canvas is a working prototype, this is also *testable* on it: the
five-second test is the T1 test. If the glance needs a tap, T1 is wrong.

## How the canvas is put together

`/design` carries its own mechanics — the seeding helper, the publish rules, the
`.dc.html` format. **Do not restate them here; they will rot.** What belongs in
this brief is the design-level shape the executing session has to know before it
starts:

**Artboards.** Six files in `design/home-canvas/`, phone-first at **390 × 844**
(the app has a bottom nav and safe-area insets, so phone is the honest target):

| File | Artboard | What it must show |
|---|---|---|
| `Main.dc.html` | **Home — variant A** | Systemic readiness **gates** the local read (a bad recovery day visibly greys/dampens what you'd otherwise be told to train) |
| `Alongside.dc.html` | **Home — variant B** | Systemic readiness sits **alongside** the local read as a separate signal |
| `MuscleDrillIn.dc.html` | **Muscle drill-in (T2)** | What a tap on one muscle reveals: its state, hours since stimulus, recent volume, and inline capture |
| `Water.dc.html` | **Water inline** | Hydration as an FRS input on the fused read — not a card, not a destination |
| `Donations.dc.html` | **Donations inline** | Eligibility window as a readiness input |
| `BodyWeight.dc.html` | **Body Weight inline** | Trend + inline logging as a Home stat |

Variant A is the file called `Main` only because the format requires an entry
file. **That is a naming convention, not a preference** — give both variants an
honest case and its main tradeoff, and set the neutral display names (`A —
readiness gates the read`, `B — readiness sits alongside`) in `canvas.json` so
the artboard headers don't put a thumb on the scale.

Artboards 4–6 each carry the same secondary fork, shown rather than asked:
**always-visible quick-add vs. revealed-on-intent.** That is the JIT question in
its most concrete form, and it decides three folds at once. It is an interaction
question, so on these three the reveal has to actually work.

**Two variants of the whole-body read** (speed, power, VO₂max, anaerobic,
cardio-endurance, skill) must appear across variants A and B, since §6's second
question is whether they get one combined read or one state each. P2 forbids
putting them on the silhouette.

**Pages.** One page per round, so nothing is renumbered or overwritten between
rounds and the earlier thinking stays visible:

```
page-1  "Structure"   round 1 — grey wireframes, the §6 fork
page-2  "Look"        round 2 — visual directions on the winner
page-3  "Refined"     round 3 — the build spec
```

Set the launch view to the page of the round in progress, so opening the link
lands on the current work rather than on last week's.

**Scenario switches.** The edge cases (a bad recovery day, a zero-data day, a
deload week, donation-ineligible) belong on the artboard as a small switch above
it, not as six more artboards. Keep them few and behavioural — one `scenario`
enum and one `deload` toggle is the right budget. Everything else stays literal
text on the artboard so it can be retyped in place.

**Icons** are drawn inline SVG on one grid, one stroke style, recolouring with
state. No emoji anywhere on the canvas.

## Exact steps

### Step 0 — pull the real data (do not skip)

With placeholder data the five-second test proves nothing; fake numbers are
always legible. Query the live DB and paste the results into the design prompt:

```sql
-- muscle coverage this cycle
select mg.name, count(ss.id) as sets
from session_sets ss
join session_exercises se on se.id = ss.session_exercise_id
join exercise_muscle_groups emg on emg.exercise_id = se.exercise_id
join muscle_groups mg on mg.id = emg.muscle_group_id
join training_sessions ts on ts.id = se.session_id
where ts.date >= current_date - 42
group by mg.name order by sets;

-- hours since each muscle was last stimulated
-- (same joins, max(ts.date) per muscle group)

-- recovery inputs, last 7 days
select date, sleep_score, sleep_hours from sleep_logs
where date >= current_date - 7 order by date;

-- adaptation state: cardio + sport sessions this cycle
select date, type, duration, avg_hr from cardio_sessions
where date >= current_date - 42 order by date;
```

Also carry over what is already on screen: readiness **36%**, body weight
**82.2 kg**, Garmin sleep score **80**, and the real sport names (Tennis, Beach
Volleyball).

### Step 1 — round 1: settle the structure

Invoke `/design` with the round-1 prompt below. Do **not** hand it the doctrine
and hope; the prompt already carries the parts that constrain design, because a
canvas prompt that says "read the doctrine" produces a canvas that ignores it.

Round 1 is **low-fi on purpose**: grey boxes, real numbers, one weight of type,
no colour decisions. Structure only. Working controls only where the fork *is* an
interaction — the muscle tap on artboards 1–2, the quick-add reveal on 4–6.
Everything else can be inert this round.

**Override the skill's default.** `/design` will otherwise try to match the
existing app pixel-perfectly without being asked, and here that is exactly wrong:
there is no design system to match. `src/constants/colors.ts` is a flat token bag
(slate + `#6366f1` indigo), `src/index.css` is Tailwind v4 plus four keyframes,
and there is no `tailwind.config.*` at all. Read the code for **structure, the
nine adaptations, the muscle list and the real numbers**; inherit **none of the
look**.

If saving turns out not to be enabled for this account, the canvas is still
viewable and exportable — but edits made in the editor will not stick, so
rounds 2 and 3 come back through this brief instead of being done by hand.

### Step 2 — the timed test, and the checks I can actually run

These are split by who can honestly do them. Both halves are pass/fail.

**Yours, on first paint, before tapping anything:** open artboards A and B for
five seconds each. Can you name the under-stimulated muscles, the untouched
adaptations, and whether to push? Write the answer down — the acceptance
criterion is that the test was *performed*, not reasoned about. Only then start
tapping.

**Mine, on the working files, after handing the canvas over** (the design skill's
own rule is to show it first and check it after, not to make you wait):

- **P2.** Is anything whole-body drawn on the silhouette? Is anything spatial
  drawn as a bar? Either is a fail.
- **T1 budget.** List every component in T1 and estimate its weight. Recharts
  alone is a large dependency — if a chart is in T1, justify it or move it.
- **Placeholders.** Every recovery threshold is labelled `PLACEHOLDER`.

### Step 3 — decide §6 with the canvas in hand

Answer the two open questions in [010-home-fused-reads.md](010-home-fused-reads.md) §6
by picking, then **record the decision and the reason in that brief** and flip
its status from `proposed` to `agreed`. The canvas is the evidence; the brief
stays the record.

### Step 4 — round 2: settle the look

Update the same canvas — new page, not a new canvas. If the canvas was edited in
the editor, read it back into the working files first, or those edits are
discarded.

Put **2–3 genuinely different visual directions** on the winning structure, each
exploring an axis that can be named out loud, each with an honest motivation and
its main tradeoff. Three shades of one aesthetic is not a choice. Then pick one.

### Step 5 — round 3: refine into a build spec

The picked structure in the picked language, built into `Main.dc.html`: real
states, real edge cases via the scenario switches (a muscle never trained, a
zero-data day, a deload week, donation-ineligible), full working controls, and
the T1/T2/T3 tier of every component written on the artboard itself. Move the
unchosen sketches to their own page rather than deleting them — they are the
record of why.

Run the five-second test again here, on the refined design. Round 1 proved the
structure carries the answer; this proves the finished look still does.

### Step 6 — write the design system down

One short doc, `docs/design-system.md`, reference-only per the house rule: type
scale, colour and state semantics, spacing, the icon rules, the component tier
table, and the rule for deciding a new component's tier. It records what *is*;
anything pending comes back here. Cite the canvas URL as the visual source.

### Step 7 — `/ground` the recovery windows

Only now. The gate needs: how long until a muscle is "recovered", whether it
varies by muscle size, and whether local recovery needs a rolling window at all.
The `## Grounding` block lands in `010-home-fused-reads.md`, and the constants get
source comments. **No placeholder threshold may become code before this.**

### Step 8 — build, and unblock R1

Implement the refined design, then the three folds land on the surface that was
designed for them, and `DEFAULTS` finally seeds four menu sections.

## The round-1 prompt

Rounds 2 and 3 do not re-paste this; they carry only what changed.

> Design the Home screen for Tekiō, a single-user training app. Phone-first,
> 390 × 844. This round is **low-fi**: grey boxes, real numbers, structure only —
> no colour or type decisions yet, those are round 2.
>
> **The one sentence the app exists for:** *Tekiō tells me what's missing.*
> Whether my training is balanced across nine adaptations and the muscles that
> serve them, and whether I'm recovered enough to close the gap today.
>
> **The screen succeeds only if:** I open it and, without tapping anything, know
> within five seconds which muscles are under-stimulated this cycle, which
> adaptations are untouched, and whether I'm recovered enough to push today.
> Everything on the screen is judged against that, and a number I cannot act on
> does not get shown.
>
> **The data has two shapes and one picture cannot carry both honestly.**
> Muscles are spatial — a body map is honest for them. Speed, power, VO₂max,
> anaerobic capacity, cardio-endurance and skill are whole-body qualities;
> putting them on a silhouette would be a beautiful lie. Use two reads.
>
> **Stimulus and recovery are two dimensions of one read, not two places.** More

> has a *state* on both: fresh & under-stimulated (train it), recently hit &
> recovering (leave it), recovered & due (train it), chronically hammered (back
> off). Recovery also has a systemic level — sleep, sauna, cold, hydration, HRV,
> blood-donation status — which is one global number answering "can I push at
> all today?"
>
> **Just-in-time is a design rule, not just a build rule.** Sort every component

> Build a visual language that serves a five-second glanceable read.
>
> **Icons are inline SVG on one grid, one stroke style, recolouring with state.**

## Out of scope

- **The capture screens.** Weights, Cardio, Mobility, Program. Doctrine §1: the
  read is the product, capture is overhead.
- **Any new section.** R1 is the argument; this brief exists to make the cap
  reachable, not to spend its headroom.
- **Machinery for managing sections.** R3 forbids it.
- **Writing any physiological number.** Step 7 is the gate.
- **The Sports → Cardio DB merge.** Still its own brief.
- **Restating how `/design` works.** The skill carries its own mechanics; this
  brief carries only the decisions the skill will ask for.

## Acceptance

- Six artboards exist on one published canvas, using real data, and its URL is
  recorded at the top of this file.
- `design/home-canvas/` is committed and re-seeds the canvas.
- The five-second test has actually been performed **twice** — round 1 and round
  3 — and both results are written down, not reasoned about.
- Both §6 questions are answered in `010-home-fused-reads.md` with the canvas cited.
- Every component on the refined artboard carries a T1/T2/T3 label, and the T1
  set is small enough to defend as an initial chunk.
- `docs/design-system.md` exists and is reference-only.
