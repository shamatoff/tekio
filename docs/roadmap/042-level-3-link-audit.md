# Roadmap: Level-3 muscle links — audit, relabel, then zero the tier

**Label:** feature
**Status:** planned — the link list in §2 is ready for Peter to tick; nothing
moves in the database or the constant until he has. Created 2026-09-02 from
[039](039-adaptations-read-grounding.md) scout run S1.

---

## The plain summary

Every logged set is credited to each muscle the exercise trains, weighted by
the muscle's link level: level 1 counts as one set, level 2 as half, level 3
as a quarter (`LEVEL_WEIGHT` in `src/lib/utils.ts`). Scout run S1 in 039
grounded those weights on 2026-09-02. Half a set for a level-2 synergist is
**supported** (Pelland 2026's best-fit counting; row-vs-curl and bench-vs-
extension trials). A quarter set for level 3 is **convention only**: no study
measures a quarter-set stimulus, and the minor contributors that were measured
(hamstrings in squats, the medial deltoid in the bench press) did not grow at
all. The scout's default is **0** — collapse to two tiers.

It could not be applied on the spot, because it comes with a precondition:
zeroing the tier only removes stimulus that is not there **if level 3 is
reserved for stabilisers and minor contributors.** An audit of
`exercise_muscle_groups` the same day found 24 stimulus links at level 3, and
about ten of them are real synergists that belong at level 2. Zeroing the
tier first would delete real stimulus from the read. So: relabel first, then
zero. The relabel is a judgement about Peter's own anatomy tags, which is why
this is a brief with a checklist and not a migration.

The full evidence and the fork it settles are in
[039 §Grounding, run S1](039-adaptations-read-grounding.md#grounding). Grounding
blocks travel with their brief and are never copied; this file only points.

## 1. What changes on Home if the proposals below are taken

Sets logged in the last 42 days on the level-3 stimulus links, and what each
relabel moves (a link going 3 → 2 gains 0.25 per set; a link staying at 3 loses
0.25 per set once the tier is zeroed):

| Muscle | Sets on level-3 links, last 42 d | Move if proposals taken |
|---|---|---|
| Upper Back / Traps | 48 (rows 9, pull-ups 9, overhead press 8, reverse fly 4, face pulls 18) | **+12** weighted sets |
| Adductors | 6 (back squat) | +1.5 |
| Anterior Deltoid | 3 (lateral raises) | +0.75 |
| Erectors | 6 (back squat) | −1.5 |
| Forearms | 9 (pull-ups) | −2.25 |

Upper Back is the one that matters. Today the app credits a quarter set for
work that the rhomboids and mid-traps are doing in every row, face pull and
reverse fly. Whether that has been reading Upper Back as *more* missing than it
is, is exactly what this brief fixes.

## 2. The audit — 24 links, one decision each

Queried 2026-09-02 (`exercise_muscle_groups` joined to `exercises`,
`muscle_groups`, `session_exercises`, `session_sets`, `training_sessions`).
Recovery-contribution links at level 3 (7 of them) are not listed: they never
add sets. **Proposed** is a proposal — tick or change it.

| # | Exercise → muscle | Sets 42 d / all | Proposed | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rows → Upper Back / Traps | 9 / 60 | **2** | Rhomboids and mid-traps retract the scapula on every rep; a co-mover, not a stabiliser. Arguably level 1. |
| 2 | Low Row → Upper Back / Traps | 0 / 5 | **2** | Same pattern as 1. |
| 3 | Single-Arm DB Row → Upper Back / Traps | 0 / 0 | **2** | Same pattern as 1. |
| 4 | Face Pulls → Upper Back / Traps | 18 / 27 | **2** | Mid/lower traps and rhomboids are co-primary with the rear delts here. |
| 5 | Face Pull → Upper Back / Traps | 0 / 0 | **2** | Duplicate exercise name of 4 — consider merging the two exercises. |
| 6 | Reverse Fly → Upper Back / Traps | 4 / 35 | **2** | As 4. |
| 7 | Band Pull-Apart → Upper Back / Traps | 0 / 0 | **2** | As 4. |
| 8 | Pull-ups → Upper Back / Traps | 9 / 39 | **2** | Lower traps and rhomboids depress and retract the scapula through the pull. |
| 9 | Overhead Press → Upper Back / Traps | 8 / 38 | **2** *(borderline)* | Upper traps upwardly rotate the scapula under load; a real synergist, but smaller than in 1–8. |
| 10 | Back Squat → Adductors | 6 / 54 | **2** | Adductor magnus grew as much as the glutes in both squat trials the scout found (Kubo 2019 +6.2 %; Plotkin 2023 +2.5 cm²). |
| 11 | Goblet Squat → Adductors | 0 / 0 | **2** | Same pattern as 10. |
| 12 | Bulgarian Split Squat → Adductors | 0 / 0 | **2** | Same pattern as 10, plus frontal-plane stabilisation. |
| 13 | Lat Raises → Anterior Deltoid | 3 / 15 | **2** *(borderline)* | The front delt shares abduction above ~30°; substantial EMG, no growth trial. |
| 14 | Back Squat → Erectors | 6 / 54 | 3 → 0 | Isometric brace; no growth data. The stabiliser the tier was made for. |
| 15 | Single-Leg RDL → Erectors | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | As 14. |
| 16 | Deadlift → Lats | 0 / 48 | 3 → 0 | Isometric hold keeping the bar close. |
| 17 | Deadlift → Upper Back / Traps | 0 / 48 | 3 → 0 *(borderline)* | Isometric hold; heavy deadlifts are credited with trap growth by lifters, but no trial measures it. |
| 18 | Bicep Curls → Forearms | 0 / 59 | 3 → 0 | Isometric grip and wrist. |
| 19 | Pull-ups → Forearms | 9 / 39 | 3 → 0 | Isometric grip. |
| 20 | Nordic Hamstring Curl → Glutes | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | Isometric hip-extension hold. |
| 21 | Scap Push-Up → Rotator Cuff | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | A serratus drill; the cuff is a bystander. |
| 22 | Hip Airplane → Adductors | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | A balance drill logged as a lift. |
| 23 | Assault Bike Intervals → Glutes | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | Conditioning entry; glute stimulus is not the point and is unmeasured. |
| 24 | Freestyle Swim → Posterior Deltoid | 0 / 0 | 3 → 0 | As 23. |

Rows 5 and 4 are the same exercise under two names; the relabel is a chance to
merge them, but that is a separate cleanup and not required here.

## 3. Doctrine §4 checklist

1. **Which read does this sharpen?** Home's body map and the per-muscle maps on
   the Adaptations tab — both Core reads. No new surface.
2. **What does it let me stop doing?** Stop crediting stimulus nobody has
   measured; stop carrying a weight tier no study or practitioner holds.
3. **Input or destination?** Input — it changes what the existing maps mean.
4. **Honest shape of the data?** Per link, spatial. The change lands on the
   silhouette, which is the right place for a per-muscle fact (P2).
5. **Does it write a number claiming physiological meaning?** Yes — level 3
   goes from 0.25 to 0. It is grounded by 039 S1, whose number-to-use is the
   band 0–0.25 with default 0; picking 0 is a choice inside a grounded range
   (`/ground` exemption 3), so no new scout run.

## 4. Steps

1. **Peter ticks §2.** Any row he changes, change the table; the table is the
   record.
2. **Apply the relabels** — one `update exercise_muscle_groups set level = 2
   where ...` per ticked row, by exercise and muscle name, on the shared
   Supabase project (production and staging read the same rows). Confirm the
   count afterwards: level-3 stimulus links should be exactly the rows left at
   3 in §2.
3. **Zero the tier in code.** `LEVEL_WEIGHT` becomes `{ 1: 1, 2: 0.5, 3: 0 }`
   (keep the key so an unknown level still reads as an explicit 0). Update its
   source comment: level 3 is now *grounded* at 0 (039 S1), not a convention.
   Two consumers must also skip zero-weight links, or a muscle will show "last
   stimulus 2 d ago" beside 0 sets: recency in `muscleStates` and the source
   list in `muscleSources`, both in `src/lib/fusedRead.ts`.
4. **Tests.** A level-3 link adds nothing to `total`, to any `byQuality`
   bucket, to recency or to sources. Existing tests that assume 0.25 move.
5. **Browser-verify** Home (the map and a muscle sheet for Upper Back) and the
   Adaptations tab. Expect Upper Back to fill in and Forearms / Erectors to
   pale.
6. **Inventory row 7.1** in [grounding-inventory.md](../grounding-inventory.md):
   verdict → grounded (level 2 supported, level 3 grounded at 0), carrier 039
   S1 + this brief. A ledger row for the relabel decision.
7. **Minor bump** — the read visibly changes.

## 5. Acceptance

- [ ] Every row in §2 carries a ticked or corrected level.
- [ ] The database holds no level-3 stimulus link that §2 marks as level 2.
- [ ] `LEVEL_WEIGHT[3]` is 0, its source comment says *grounded*, and
      zero-weight links add nothing to totals, per-quality buckets, recency or
      sources.
- [ ] Tests cover the zero-weight link and pass; the build passes.
- [ ] Home and the Adaptations tab were checked in the browser after the
      relabel, with a screenshot in the session summary.
- [ ] Inventory row 7.1 and the decisions ledger reflect the final state.

## Out of scope

- Moving the fraction into the per-link `contribution` column (one number per
  pair instead of per level) — the upgrade path S1 named; a later brief if the
  pair data ever justifies it.
- Merging the duplicate Face Pull / Face Pulls exercises.
- Any change to level 2's value. 0.5 is the only fraction ever tested against
  alternatives; do not replace it with an average of the pair results.
