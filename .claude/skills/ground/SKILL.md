name: ground
description: Pre-build gate for Tekiō. Run before implementing any change that writes, moves, or reinterprets a number claiming physiological meaning — recovery weights, adaptation targets, rep-range boundaries, FRS coefficients, recovery windows, deload placement. Checks the trigger, checks the doctrine, dispatches the science-scout subagent, and lands the result as a `## Grounding` block in the roadmap brief plus a source comment on the constant. Also invoked deliberately to back-fill a number already shipped.

# /ground — the pre-build gate

Tekiō's purpose sentence rests on numbers. A wrong weight tints a card; a wrong
target makes the app confidently name the wrong gap. This skill is the one
moment where that gets checked — before the brief becomes code.

**What it is not: a blocker.** The gate never stops you shipping a number. It
stops you shipping one *unlabelled*. `convention only` is a legitimate verdict
that unblocks implementation immediately. Silence is not a verdict.

Prerequisite: [docs/doctrine.md](../../../docs/doctrine.md) — §4 is the
checklist this skill runs. It is imported from the workspace `CLAUDE.md`, so it
should already be in context.

---

## Step 0 — Does the trigger fire?

> The gate fires when a change **writes, moves, or reinterprets a number in the
> app that claims physiological meaning** — a weight, threshold, target, window,
> or coefficient whose value asserts something about how a body adapts or
> recovers.

This is the canonical trigger spec. Doctrine §4.5 points here.

### Gated — the live surfaces

| Where | Numbers |
|---|---|
| [src/constants/app.ts](../../../src/constants/app.ts) | `RECOVERY_WEIGHTS`, `RECOVERY_TARGETS`, `CYCLE` |
| [src/constants/adaptations.ts](../../../src/constants/adaptations.ts) | `weeklyMuscleTarget`, `weeklySessionTarget`, `repRange`, every `rx` field (load / reps / sets / rest / effort / **cue**) |
| Nutrition FRS | the six sub-score weights and their cut-points |
| Local recovery | hours-since-stimulus thresholds, volume-load decay |
| Deload | which week of the cycle deloads, and by how much |

`rx.cue` is gated because prose states numbers too — see the known debt below.

### Not gated

Chart colours, layout, spacing, icons, copy that states no number, export
fields, DB column names, sort order, `USER_ID`, anything in `src/components/ui/`.

### Three exemptions — the number moves, but no new claim is made

1. **Renormalisation.** Dropping an input and rescaling the rest proportionally
   preserves every relative claim. (This is exactly the Habits reweight; the
   doctrine ledger already says so.)
2. **Unit or shape change.** Same claim, different representation — per-week to
   per-day, array to map, seconds to minutes.
3. **Rounding inside an already-grounded range.** If a `## Grounding` block gave
   48–72 h, picking 60 h is a defaults decision, not a claim.

Name the exemption you are using, in the brief or the commit message, and
proceed. **If you are arguing about whether one applies, it doesn't** — run the
scout; it is cheaper than the argument.

**If nothing fires:** say so in one line and stop. Do not run the scout for
thoroughness — a gate that fires on everything is a gate nobody reads.

---

## Step 1 — Doctrine check

Cheaper than a scout run, and it kills more features. Answer §4.1–4.4 for the
change that carries this number:

1. Which existing read does this sharpen?
2. What does it let me stop doing?
3. Input or destination? (default: input)
4. What's the honest shape of the data?

Plus the two that bite hardest here:

- **A number I can't act on doesn't get shown.** If the value could be anything
  and nothing about what the user trains or how they recover would change, the
  number does not ship — and it does not get grounded either. Stop.
- **R1: at most 4 menu sections.** If the number needs a fifth, name the trade
  before spending a scout run on it.

A number that fails Step 1 never reaches Step 2. Say which question it failed.

---

## Step 2 — Dispatch science-scout

Run [.claude/agents/science-scout.md](../../agents/science-scout.md) as a
subagent (`subagent_type: science-scout`) so the search context stays isolated
from this session.

Hand it all five inputs — it will stop and ask if any are missing:

- the claim in plain language
- the constant or field it will be written to (path + name)
- its current value, if one exists
- the brief it belongs to
- today's date

**One decision per run, not one number per run.** Nine `weeklyMuscleTarget`
values that all rest on the same question ("weekly sets per muscle group for a
trained adult") are *one* run returning one range. Nine unrelated numbers are
nine runs. Batching unrelated claims produces a block that grounds none of them.

The scout is read-only by construction. It returns a markdown block; you paste
it. Never ask it to edit the constant.

---

## Step 3 — Land it in the repo

In six months nobody remembers why sleep weight is 0.45. Three destinations, in
order:

**1. The brief** — paste the scout's block verbatim as `## Grounding`,
immediately before `## Acceptance`. Verbatim: don't summarise away the
provenance tags or the "Where they split" section, which is the part that
records a real design fork.

**2. The constant** — one line above it, from the scout's `### Source comment`:

```ts
/** 0.45 — sleep dominates systemic readiness; see docs/roadmap/<brief>.md#grounding */
```

**3. shamatoff-os `inbox/`** — *only* if the finding is durable life-knowledge
beyond Tekiō (e.g. "full-blood donation suppresses endurance performance for
weeks"). Draft it there for `/ingest` → `wiki/health/`. The *why* behind the
number stays next to the number regardless; the inbox is not a substitute for
step 2.

### Verdict vocabulary

Record the scout's verdict word in the brief so a later grounding inventory can
read it without re-reading the block:

| Scout verdict | Inventory state | What it means for shipping |
|---|---|---|
| supported / partially supported | **grounded** | ship it |
| convention only | **convention** | ship it, and the source comment must contain the word *convention* |
| not supported | — | the value changes, or the feature doesn't ship |
| (never run) | **unknown** | the state every pre-`/ground` number is in |

### Maintenance

Source comments cite a brief path, and briefs move to `docs/roadmap/done/` when
complete. When you move one, `grep -rn "<brief-filename>" src/` and repoint every
comment. Grounding blocks travel with their brief — never copy one into a second
file.

---

## Modes

**A — New number (default).** A brief is in flight; the change hasn't been
written. Steps 0 → 3 in order.

**B — Back-fill.** An existing constant, already shipped, never grounded. Same
four steps; the difference is that Step 1 is usually already settled (the
feature exists) and the brief may need creating — a one-number brief is
legitimate. Two rules from the roadmap:

- **Opportunistic first.** A number due for rewrite trips the trigger on its
  own. Don't run a back-fill sprint.
- **Targets before weights.** `adaptations.ts` `weeklyMuscleTarget` /
  `weeklySessionTarget` decide what Home calls "missing", so the purpose
  sentence rests on them. `RECOVERY_WEIGHTS.sleep = 0.45` is more memorable and
  less consequential.

Anything still **unknown** after one cycle (6 weeks) earns a deliberate run.
That reuses R2's expiry clock — do not build new machinery to track it (R3).

## Known debt

[src/constants/adaptations.ts:127](../../../src/constants/adaptations.ts#L127)
ships *"Galpin's 3–5 rule"* as a coaching cue: a named
`[single-practitioner position]` presented as settled, with no provenance. It is
the clearest live example of what this gate exists to catch.

---

## Hard rules

- The scout never edits a file. You paste its output.
- Never resolve a practitioner split by averaging. The block reports both, and
  the brief records which side Tekiō chose and why.
- Never write a number more precise than the block supports.
- A `[literature]` line without a URL is a bug — send it back.
- If the scout contradicts the value already shipped, that is a decision, not a
  find-and-replace. Record it in the brief before touching the constant.
